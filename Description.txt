Remote sensing processing library developped by CNES ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is
  distributed as an open source library of image processing algorithms. OTB is
  based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers particular
  functionalities for remote sensing image processing in general and for high
  spatial resolution images in particular. OTB is distributed under a free
  software licence CeCILL (similar to GPL) to encourage contribution from users
  and to promote reproducible research. The library is intensively tested on
  several platforms as Linux, Unix and Windows. Most functionnalies are also
  adapted to process huge images using streaming and multithreading as often as
  possible.
  .
  This package provide the new version of the Monteverdi2 GUI application
  developped in Qt around the OTB library.
