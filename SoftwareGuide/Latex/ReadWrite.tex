\chapter{Reading and Writing Images}
\label{sec:IO}

This chapter describes the toolkit architecture supporting reading and
writing of images to files. OTB does not enforce any particular file
format, instead, it provides a structure inherited from ITK,
supporting a variety of formats that can be easily extended by the
user as new formats become available.

We begin the chapter with some simple examples of file I/O.

The following section describes the internals of the IO architecture provided
in the toolkit.

\section{Pluggable Factories}
\label{sec:ImageIOPluggableFactories}

The principle behind the input/output mechanism used in ITK is known as
\emph{pluggable-factories} \cite{Gamma1995}. This concept is illustrated in
the UML diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOCollaborationDiagram}. From the
user's point of view the objects responsible for reading and writing files
are the \doxygen{ImageFileReader} and \doxygen{ImageFileWriter}
classes. These two classes, however, are not aware of the details involved in
reading or writing particular file formats like PNG or DICOM.  What they do
is to dispatch the user's requests to a set of specific classes that are
aware of the details of image file formats. These classes are the
\doxygen{ImageIO} classes. The ITK delegation mechanism enables users to
extend the number of supported file formats by just adding new classes to the
ImageIO hierarchy.

Each instance of ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter has
a pointer to an ImageIO object. If this pointer is empty, it will
be impossible to read or write an image and the image file reader/writer must
determine which ImageIO class to use to perform IO operations.
This is done basically by passing the filename to a centralized class, the
\doxygen{ImageIOFactory} and asking it to identify any subclass of
ImageIO capable of reading or writing the user-specified file. This
is illustrated by the use cases on the right side of
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. The ImageIOFactory acts here as a
dispatcher that help to locate the actual IO factory classes corresponding to
each file format.

Each class derived from ImageIO must provide an associated factory
class capable of producing an instance of the ImageIO class. For
example, for PNG files, there is a \doxygen{PNGImageIO} object that knows how
to read this image files and there is a \doxygen{PNGImageIOFactory} class
capable of constructing a PNGImageIO object and returning a pointer
to it.  Each time a new file format is added (i.e., a new ImageIO
subclass is created), a factory must be implemented as a derived class of the
ObjectFactoryBase class as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesClassDiagram}.

For example, in order to read PNG files, a PNGImageIOFactory is
created and registered with the central ImageIOFactory
singleton\footnote{\emph{Singleton} means that there is only one instance of
this class in a particular application} class as illustrated in the left side
of Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. When the ImageFileReader asks
the ImageIOFactory for an ImageIO capable of reading the
file identified with \emph{filename} the ImageIOFactory will iterate over the
list of registered factories and will ask each one of them is they know how
to read the file. The factory that responds affirmatively will be used to
create the specific ImageIO instance that will be returned to the
ImageFileReader and used to perform the read operations.

In most cases the mechanism is transparent to the user who only interacts
with the ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter. It is
possible, however, to explicitly select the type of ImageIO object
to use.  This is illustrated by the following example.

\section{Reading and Writing Vector Images}
\label{sec:VectorImagReadWrite}

Images whose pixel type is a Vector, a CovariantVector, an Array, or a Complex
are quite common in image processing. It is convenient then to describe rapidly
how those images can be saved into files and how they can be read from those
files later on.

\section{Reading and Writing Image Series}

It is still quite common to store 3D medical images in sets of files each one
containing a single slice of a volume dataset. Those 2D files can be read as
individual 2D images, or can be grouped together in order to reconstruct a 3D
dataset. The same practice can be extended to higher dimensions, for example,
for managing 4D datasets by using sets of files each one containing a 3D image.
This practice is common in the domain of cardiac imaging, perfusion, functional
MRI and PET. This section illustrates the functionalities available in ITK for
dealing with reading and writing series of images.

\subsection{Foreword}
With the introduction of computed tomography (CT) followed by other digital
diagnostic imaging modalities such as MRI in the 1970's, and the increasing use
of computers in clinical applications, the American College of Radiology
(ACR)\footnote{\url{http://www.acr.org}} and the National Electrical
Manufacturers Association (NEMA)\footnote{\url{http://www.nema.org}} recognized
the need for a standard method for transferring images as well as associated
information between devices manufactured from various vendors.

ACR and NEMA formed a joint committee to develop a standard for Digital Imaging
and Communications in Medicine (DICOM).  This standard was developed in liaison
with other Standardization Organizations such as CEN TC251, JIRA including
IEEE, HL7 and ANSI USA as reviewers.

DICOM is a comprehensive set of standards for handling, storing and
transmitting information in medical imaging. The DICOM standard was developed
based on the previous NEMA specification.  The standard specifies a file format
definition as well as a network communication protocol. DICOM was developed to
enable integration of scanners, servers, workstations and network hardware from
multiple vendors into an image archiving and communication system.

DICOM files consist of a header and a body of image data. The header contains
standardized as well as free-form fields. The set of standardized fields is
called the public DICOM dictionary, an instance of this dictionary is available
in ITK in the file~\code{Insight/Utilities/gdcm/Dict/dicomV3.dic}.  The list of
free-form fields is also called the \emph{shadow dictionary}.

A single DICOM file can contain multiples frames, allowing storage of volumes
or animations. Image data can be compressed using a large variety of standards,
including JPEG (both lossy and lossless), LZW (Lempel Ziv Welch), and RLE
(Run-length encoding).

The DICOM Standard is an evolving standard and it is maintained in accordance
with the Procedures of the DICOM Standards Committee. Proposals for
enhancements are forthcoming from the DICOM Committee member organizations
based on input from users of the Standard. These proposals are considered for
inclusion in future editions of the Standard. A requirement in updating the
Standard is to maintain effective compatibility with previous editions.

For a more detailed description of the DICOM standard see~\cite{DICOMStandard}.

The following sections illustrate how to use the functionalities that ITK
provides for reading and writing DICOM files. This is extremely important in
the domain of medical imaging since most of the images that are acquired a
clinical setting are stored and transported using the DICOM standard.

DICOM functionalities in ITK are provided by the GDCM library. This open source
library was developed by the CREATIS
Team~\footnote{\url{http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr}} at
INSA-Lyon~\cite{CreatisINSA-Lyon}.  Although originally this library was
distributed under a LGPL
License\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}}, the CREATIS Team was
lucid enough to understand the limitations of that license and agreed to adopt
the more open BSD-like
License\footnote{\url{http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php}} that is
used by ITK. This change in their licensing made possible to distribute GDCM
along with ITK.

GDCM is still being maintained and improved at the original CREATIS site and
the version distributed with ITK gets updated with major releases of the GDCM
library.
