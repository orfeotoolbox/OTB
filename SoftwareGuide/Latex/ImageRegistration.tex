This chapter introduces OTB's (actually mainly ITK's) capabilities for performing image
registration. Please note that the disparity map estimation approach
presented in chapter \ref{sec:DisparityMapEstimation} are very closely
related to image registration. Image registration is the process of
determining the spatial transform that maps points from one image to
homologous points on a object in the second image. This concept is
schematically represented in Figure
\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationConcept}. In OTB, registration is performed
within a framework of pluggable components that can easily be
interchanged.  This flexibility means that a combinatorial variety of
registration methods can be created, allowing users to pick and choose
the right tools for their specific application.


\section{Registration Framework}
The components of the registration framework and their interconnections are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:RegistrationComponents}. The basic input data to the
registration process are two images: one is defined as the \emph{fixed} image
$f(\bf{X})$ and the other as the \emph{moving} image $m(\bf{X})$. Where
$\bf{X}$ represents a position in N-dimensional space. Registration is treated
as an optimization problem with the goal of finding the spatial mapping that
will bring the moving image into alignment with the fixed image.

\itkcaption[Registration Framework Components]{The basic components of the
registration framework are two input images, a transform, a metric, an
interpolator and an optimizer.}
\label{fig:RegistrationComponents}
\end{figure}

The \emph{transform} component $T(\bf{X})$ represents the spatial mapping of
points from the fixed image space to points in the moving image space. The
\emph{interpolator} is used to evaluate moving image intensities at non-grid
positions. The \emph{metric} component $S(f,m \circ T)$ provides a measure of
how well the fixed image is matched by the transformed moving image. This
measure forms the quantitative criterion to be optimized by the
\emph{optimizer} over the search space defined by the parameters of the
\emph{transform}.

These various OTB/ITK registration components will be described in later
sections.  First, we begin with some simple registration examples.

%% This section presents a discussion on the two most common difficulties that
%% users encounter when they start using the ITK registration framework. They are,
%% in order of difficulty

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item The direction of the Transform mapping
%% \item The fact that registration is done in physical coordinates
%% \end{itemize}

%% Probably the reason why these two topics tend to create confusion is that they
%% are implemented in different ways in other systems and therefore users tend to
%% have different expectations regarding how things should work in ITK. The
%% situation is further complicated by the fact that most people describe image
%% operations as if they were manually performed in a picture in paper.

%% \subsection{Direction of the Transform Mapping}
%% \label{sec:DirectionOfTheTransformMapping}

%% The Transform that is optimized in the ITK registration framework is the one
%% that maps points from the physical space of the fixed image into the physical
%% space of the moving image. This is illustrated in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}. This implies that
%% the Transform will accept as input points from the fixed image and it will
%% compute the coordinates of the analogous points in the moving image. What tends
%% to create confusion is the fact that when the Transform shifts a point on the
%% \textbf{positive} X direction, the visual effect of this mapping, once the
%% moving image is resampled, is equivalent to {\em manually shifting} the moving
%% image along the \textbf{negative} X direction. In the same way, when the
%% Transform applies a \textbf{clock-wise} rotation to the fixed image points, the
%% visual effect of this mapping once the moving image has been resampled is
%% equivalent to {\em manually rotating} the moving image
%% \textbf{counter-clock-wise}. 

%% The reason why this direction of mapping has been chosen for the ITK
%% implementation of the registration framework is that this is the direction that
%% better fits the fact that the moving image is expected to be resampled using
%% the grid of the fixed image. The nature of the resampling process is such that
%% an algorithm must go through every pixel of the {\em fixed} image and compute
%% the intensity that should be assigned to this pixel from the mapping of the
%% {\em moving} image. This computation involves taking the integral coordinates
%% of the pixel in the image grid, usually called the ``(i,j)'' coordinates,
%% mapping them into the physical space of the fixed image (transform \textbf{T1}
%% in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}), mapping those
%% physical coordinates into the physical space of the moving image (Transform to
%% be optimized), then mapping the physical coordinates of the moving image in to
%% the integral coordinates of the discrete grid of the moving image (transform
%% \textbf{T2} in the figure), where the value of the pixel intensity will be
%% computed by interpolation. 

%% If we have used the Transform that maps coordinates from the moving image
%% physical space into the fixed image physical space, then the resampling process
%% could not guarantee that every pixel in the grid of the fixed image was going
%% to receive one and only one value. In other words, the resampling will have
%% resulted in an image with holes and with redundant or overlapped pixel values.

%% As you have seen in the previous examples, and you will corroborate in the
%% remaining examples in this chapter, the Transform computed by the registration
%% framework is the Transform that can be used directly in the resampling filter
%% in order to map the moving image into the discrete grid of the fixed image.

%% There are exceptional cases in which the transform that you want is actually
%% the inverse transform of the one computed by the ITK registration framework.
%% Only in those cases you may have to recur to invoking the \code{GetInverse()}
%% method that most transform offer.  Make sure that before you consider following
%% that dark path, you interact with the examples of resampling illustrated in
%% section~\ref{sec:GeometricalTransformationFilters} in order to get familiar
%% with the correct interpretation of the transforms.


%% \subsection{Registration is done in physical space}
%% \label{sec:RegistrationIsDoneInPhysicalSpace}

%% The second common difficulty that users encounter with the ITK registration
%% framework is related to the fact that ITK performs registration in the context
%% of physical space and not in the discrete space of the image grid.
%% Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram} show this concept by
%% crossing the transform that goes between the two image grids. One important
%% consequence of this fact is that having the correct image origin and image
%% pixel size is fundamental for the success of the registration process in ITK.
%% Users must make sure that they provide correct values for the origin and
%% spacing of both the fixed and moving images.

%% A typical case that helps to understand this issue, is to consider the
%% registration of two images where one has a pixel size different from the other.
%% For example, a PET\footnote{Positron Emission Tomography} image and a
%% CT\footnote{Computer Tomography in X-rays} image. Typically a CT image will
%% have a pixel size in the order of 1 millimeter, while a PET image will have a
%% pixel size in the order of 5 millimeters to 1 centimeter. Therefore, the CT
%% will need about 500 pixels in order to cover the extent across a human brain, while
%% the PET image will only have about 50 pixels for covering the same physical
%% extent of a human brain. 

%% A user performing registration between a PET image and a CT image may be
%% naively expecting that because the PET image has less pixels, a {\em scaling}
%% factor is required in the Transform in order to map this image into the CT
%% image. At that point, this person is attempting to interpret the registration
%% process directly between the two image grids, or in {\em pixel space}. What ITK
%% will do in this case is to take into account the pixel size that the user has
%% provided and it will use that pixel size in order to compute a scaling factor
%% for Transforms {\em T1} and {\em T2} in
%% Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}. Since these two
%% transforms take care of the required scaling factor, the spatial Transform to
%% be computed during the registration process does not need to be concerned about
%% such scaling. The transform that ITK is computing is the one that will
%% physically map the brain from the moving image into the brain of the fixed
%% image.

%% In order to better understand this concepts, it is very useful to draw sketches
%% of the fixed and moving image {\em at scale} in the same physical coordinate
%% system. That is the geometrical configuration that the ITK registration
%% framework uses as context. Keeping this in mind helps a lot for interpreting
%% correctly the results of a registration process performed with ITK.

\section{Multi-Modality Registration}
\label{sec:MultiModalityRegistration}

Some of the most challenging cases of image registration arise when images of
different modalities are involved. In such cases, metrics based on direct
comparison of gray levels are not applicable. It has been extensively shown
that metrics based on the evaluation of mutual information are well suited for
overcoming the difficulties of multi-modality registration.

\index{itk::Image\-Registration\-Method!Multi-Modality}

The concept of Mutual Information is derived from Information Theory and its
application to image registration has been proposed in different forms by
different groups \cite{Collignon1995,Maes97,Viola1997}, a more detailed review
can be found in \cite{Hajnal2001,Pluim2003}. The OTB, through ITK, currently
provides five different implementations of Mutual Information metrics (see
section \ref{sec:Metrics} for details). The following example illustrates the
practical use of some of these metrics.

%% \fi


\section{ Centered Transforms }

The OTB/ITK image coordinate origin is typically located in one of the image
corners (see section ~\ref{sec:DefiningImageOriginAndSpacing} for details).
This results in counter-intuitive transform behavior when rotations and scaling
are involved. Users tend to assume that rotations and scaling are performed
around a fixed point at the center of the image.  In order to compensate for
this difference in natural interpretation, the concept of \emph{centered}
transforms have been introduced into the toolkit. The following sections
describe the main characteristics of such transforms.

%% The introduction of the centered transforms in the Insight Toolkit reflects the
%% dynamic nature of a software library when it evolves in harmony with the
%% requests of the community that it serves. This dynamism has, as everything else
%% in real life, some advantages and some disadvantages. The main advantage is that
%% when a need is identified by the users, it gets implemented in a matter of days
%% or weeks.  This capability for rapidly responding to the needs of a community
%% is one of the major strengths of Open Source software. It has the additional
%% safety that if the rest of the community does not wish to adopt a particular
%% change, an isolated user can always implement that change in her local copy of
%% the toolkit, since all the source code of ITK is available in a BSD-style
%% license\footnote{\url{http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php}} that
%% does not restrict modification nor distribution of the code, and that does not
%% impose the assimilation demands of viral licenses such as
%% GPL\footnote{\url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html}}.

%% The main disadvantage of dynamism, is of course, the fact that there is
%% continuous change and a need for perpetual adaptation. The evolution of
%% software occurs at different scales, some changes happen to evolve in localized
%% regions of the code, while from time to time accommodations of a larger scale
%% are needed. The need for continuous changes is addressed in Extreme Programming
%% with the methodology of \emph{Refactoring}. At any given point, the structure
%% of the code may not project the organized and neatly distributed architecture
%% that may have resulted from a monolithic and static design. There is, after
%% all, good reasons why living beings can not have straight angles. What you are
%% about to witness in this section is a clear example of the diversity of species
%% that flourishes when Evolution is in action~\cite{Darwin1999}.

%% \section{Multi-Resolution Registration}
%% \label{sec:MultiResolutionRegistration}
%% Performing image registration using a multi-resolution approach is widely used
%% to improve speed, accuracy and robustness. The basic idea is that registration
%% is first performed at a coarse scale where the images have fewer pixels.
%% The spatial mapping determined at the coarse level is then used to initialize
%% registration at the next finer scale. This process is repeated until it
%% reaches the finest possible scale. This coarse-to-fine strategy greatly
%% improve the registration success rate and also increases robustness
%% by eliminating local optima at coarser scales.

%% The Insight Toolkit offers a multi-resolution registration framework that is
%% directly compatible with all the registration framework components. The
%% multi-resolution registration framework has two additional components: a pair
%% of \emph{image pyramids} that are used to down-sample the fixed and moving
%% images as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:MultiResRegistrationComponents}.
%% The pyramids smooth and subsample the images according to user-defined
%% scheduling of shrink factors.

%% \section{Point Set Registration}
%% \label{sec:PointSetRegistration}

%% PointSet-to-PointSet registration is a common problem in medical image
%% analysis. It usually arises in cases where landmarks are extracted from images
%% and are used for establishing the spatial correspondence between the images.
%% This type of registration can be considered to be the simplest case of
%% feature-based registration. In general terms, feature-based registration is
%% more efficient than the intensity based method that we have presented so far.
%% However, feature-base registration brings the new problem of identifying and
%% extracting the features from the images, which is not a minor challenge. 

%% The two most common scenarios in PointSet to PointSet registration are

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Two PointSets with the same number of points, and where each point in one
%% set has a known correspondence to exactly one point in the second set.
%% \item Two PointSets without known correspondences between the points of one set
%% and the points of the other. In this case the PointSets may have different
%% numbers of points.
%% \end{itemize}

%% The first case can be solved with a closed form solution when we are dealing
%% with a Rigid or an Affine Transform~\cite{Horn1987}. This is done in ITK with
%% the class \doxygen{LandmarkBasedTransformInitializer}. If we are interested in
%% a deformable Transformation then the problem can be solved with the
%% \doxygen{KernelTransform} family of classes, which includes Thin Plate Splines
%% among others~\cite{Rohr2001}. In both circumstances, the availability o f
%% correspondences between the points make possible to apply a straight forward
%% solution to the problem.


%% The classical algorithm for performing PointSet to PointSet registration is the
%% Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.  The following examples illustrate how
%% this can be used in ITK.

%% \section{Registration Troubleshooting}
%% So you read the previous sections, you wrote the code, it compiles and links fine,
%% but when you run it the registration results are not what you were expecting.
%% In that case, this section is for you. This is a compilation of the most common
%% problems that users face when performing image registration. It provides explanations
%% on the potential sources of the problems, and advice on how to deal with those problems.

%% Most of the material in this section has been taken from frequently asked questions of 
%% the ITK users list.


%% \subsection{Too many samples outside moving image buffer}


%% http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/insight-users/2007-March/021442.html

%% This is a common error message in image registration.

%% It means that at the current iteration of the optimization,
%% the two images as so off-registration that their spatial
%% overlap is not large enough for bringing them back into
%% registration.

%% The common causes of this problem are:

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Poor initialization:    You must initialize the transform properly.
%% Please read the ITK Software Guide http://www.itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf  for
%% a description of the use of the CenteredTransformInitializer class.
%% \item Optimzer steps too large. If you optimizer takes steps that are too
%% large, it risks to become unstable and to send the images too far appart.  You
%% may want to start the optimizer with a maximum step lenght of 1.0, and only
%% increase it once you have managed to fine tune all other registration
%% parameters.

%% Increasing the step length makes your program faster, but it also makes it more
%% unstable.



%% \item Poor set up o the transform parameters scaling.  This is extremely
%% critical in registration. You must make sure that you balance the relative
%% difference of scale between the rotation parameters and the translation
%% parameters.

%% In typical medical datasets such as CT and MR, translations are measured in
%% millimeters, and therefore are in the range of -100:100, while rotations are
%% measured in radians, and therefore they tend to be in the range of   -1:1.


%% A rotation of 3 radians is catastrophic, while a translation of 3 millimeters
%% is rather inoffensive.  That difference in scale is the one that must be
%% accounted for.  
%% \end{itemize}



%% \subsection{General heuristics for parameter fine-tunning}





%% http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/insight-users/2007-March/021435.html

%% Here is some advice on how to fine tune the parameters
%% of the registration process.


%% 1) Set Maximum step length to 0.1 and do not change it
%%    until all other parameters are stable.

%% 2) Set Minimum step length to 0.001 and do not change it.

%%    You could interpret these two parameters as if their
%%    units were radians. So, 0.1 radian = 5.7 degrees.


%% 3) Number of histogram bins:

%%     First plot the histogram of your image using the
%%     example program in

%%     Insight/Examples/Statistics/ImageHistogram2.cxx

%%     In that program use first a large number  of bins
%%     (for example 2000) and identify the different
%%     populations of intensity level and to what anatomical
%%     structures they correspond.

%%     Once you identify the anatomical structures in the
%%     histogram, then rerun that same program with less
%%     and less number of bins, until you reach the minimun
%%     number of bins for which all the tissues that are important
%%     for your application, are still distinctly differentiated in the
%%     histogram.  At that point, take that number of bins and
%%     us it for your Mutual Information metric.


%% 4)  Number of Samples:
%%     The trade-off with the number of samples is the following:

%%     a) computation time of registration is linearly proportional
%%        to the number of samples
%%                                                                                                                         b) the samples must be enough to significantly populate
%%                                                                                                                            the joint histogram.
%%                                                                                                                         c) Once the histogram is populated, there is not much
%%                                                                                                                            use in adding more samples.
%% Therefore do the following:

%% Plot the joint histogram of both images, using the number
%% of bins that you selected in item (3). You can do this by
%% modifying the code of the example:

%% Insight/Examples/Statistics/
%% ImageMutualInformation1.cxx
%% you have to change the code to print out the values
%% of the bins. Then use a plotting program such as gnuplot,
%% or Matlab, or even Excel and look at the distribution.
%% The number of samples to take must be enough
%% for producing the same "appearance" of the joint histogram.
%% As an arbitrary rule of thumb you may want to start using
%% a high number of samples (80% ~ 100%). And do not
%% change it until you have mastered the other parameters
%% of the registration.  Once you get your registration to converge
%% you can revisit the number of samples and reduce it in order
%% to make the registration run faster. You can simply reduce it
%% until you find that the registration becomes unstable. That's
%% your critical bound for the minimum number of samples.
%% Take that number and multiply it by the magic number 1.5,
%% to send it back to a stable region, or if your application is
%% really critical, then use an even higher magic number x2.0.

%% This is just engineering: you figure out what is the minimal
%% size of a piece of steel that will support a bridge, and then
%% you enlarge it to keep it away from the critical value.

%% 5)  The MOST critical values of the registration process are the
%% scaling parameters that define the proportions between
%% the parameters of the transform. In your case, for an Affine
%% Transform in 2D, you have 6 parameters. The first four are
%% the ones of the Matrix, and the last two are the translation.
%% The rotation matrix value must be in the ranges of radians
%% which is typically [ -1 to 1 ], while the translation values are
%% in the ranges of millimeters (your image size units).
%% You want to start by setting the scaling of the matrix
%% parameters to 1.0, and the scaling of the Translation
%% parameters to the holy esoteric values:

%% 1.0   /  (  10.0 * pixelspacing[0]  *  imagesize[0]  )
%% 1.0   /  (  10.0 * pixelspacing[1]  *  imagesize[1]  )

%% This is telling the optimizer that you consider that rotating
%% the image by 57 degrees is as "significant" as translating
%% the image by half its physical extent.

%% Note that esoteric value has included the arbitrary number
%% 10.0 in the denominator, for no other reason that we have
%% been lucky when using that factor. This of course is just a
%% supersticion, so you should feel free to experiment with
%% different values of this number.

%% Just keep in mind that what the optimizer will do is to
%% "jump" in a paramteric space of 6 dimension, and that the
%% component of the jump on every dimension will be proporitional
%% to 1/scaling factor * OptimizerStepLenght.     Since you put
%% the optimizer Step Length to 0.1, then the optimizer will start
%% by exploring the rotations at jumps of about 5degrees, which
%% is a conservative rotation for most medical applications.

%% If you have reasons to think that your rotations are larger or
%% smaller, then you should modify the scaling factor of the  matrix
%% parameters accordingly.

%% In the same way, if you thinkl that 1/10 of the image size is too
%% large as the first step for exploring the translations, then you
%% should modify the scaling of  translation parameters accordingly.



%% In order to drive all these you need to analyze the feedback that
%% the observer is providing you. For example, plot the metric values,
%% and plot the translation coordinates so that you can get a feeling
%% of how the registration is behaving.


%% Note also that image registration is not a science. it is a pure
%% engineerig practice, and therefore, there are no correct answers,
%% nor "truths" to be found. It is all about how much quality your want,
%% and how must computation time, and development time are you
%% willing to pay for that quality. The "satisfying" answer for your
%% specific application must be found by exploring the trade-offs
%% between the different parameters that regulate the image
%% registration process.

%% If you are proficient in VTK you may want to consider attaching
%% some visualization to the Event observer, so that you can have
%% a visual feedback on the progress of the registration. This is a
%% lot more productive than trying to interpret the values printed
%% out on the console by the observer.
