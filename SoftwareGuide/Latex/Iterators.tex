\index{Generic Programming}
This chapter introduces the \emph{image iterator}, an important generic
programming construct for image processing in ITK.  An iterator is a
generalization of the familiar C programming language pointer used to
reference data in memory.  ITK has a wide variety of image iterators, some of
which are highly specialized to simplify common image processing tasks.

The next section is a brief introduction that defines iterators in the context
of ITK.  Section \ref{sec:IteratorsInterface} describes the programming
interface common to most ITK image iterators.
Sections~\ref{sec:ImageIterators}--\ref{sec:NeighborhoodIterators} document
specific ITK iterator types and provide examples of how they are used.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:IteratorsIntroduction}
% Further define iterators in the context of generic programming.
\index{generic programming}
\index{Iterators!definition of}
Generic programming models define functionally independent components called
\emph{containers} and \emph{algorithms}.  Container objects store data and
algorithms operate on data.  To access data in containers, algorithms use a
third class of objects called \emph{iterators}.  An iterator is an
abstraction of a memory pointer.  Every container type must define its own
iterator type, but all iterators are written to provide a common interface so
that algorithm code can reference data in a generic way and maintain
functional independence from containers.

The iterator is so named because it is used for \emph{iterative}, sequential
access of container values.  Iterators appear in \code{for} and
\code{while} loop constructs, visiting each data point in turn.  
A C pointer, for example, is a type of iterator.  It can be moved
forward (incremented) and backward (decremented) through memory to
sequentially reference elements of an array. Many iterator implementations
have an interface similar to a C pointer.

\index{Iterators!advantages of}
In ITK we use iterators to write generic image processing code for images
instantiated with different combinations of pixel type, pixel
container type, and dimensionality.  Because ITK image iterators are
specifically designed to work with \emph{image} containers, their interface and
implementation is optimized for image processing tasks.  Using the ITK
iterators instead of accessing data directly through the
\doxygen{otb}{Image} interface has many advantages. Code is more
compact and often generalizes automatically to higher dimensions, algorithms
run much faster, and iterators simplify tasks such as multithreading and
neighborhood-based image processing.


\section{Programming Interface}
\label{sec:IteratorsInterface}

\index{Iterators!programming interface|(}
%Creating iterators
This section describes the standard ITK image iterator programming interface.
Some specialized image iterators may deviate from this standard or provide
additional methods.

\subsection{Creating Iterators}
\label{sec:CreatingIterators}

\index{Iterators!construction of}
All image iterators have at least one template parameter that is the image
type over which they iterate.  There is no restriction on the dimensionality
of the image or on the pixel type of the image.

\index{Iterators!and image regions}

An iterator constructor requires at least two arguments, a smart pointer to the
image to iterate across, and an image region. The image region, called the
\emph{iteration region}, is a rectilinear area in which iteration is
constrained.  The iteration region must be wholly contained within the image.
More specifically, a valid iteration region is any subregion of the image
within the current \code{BufferedRegion}.  See Section~\ref{sec:ImageSection}
for more information on image regions.

\index{Iterators!const}
There is a const and a non-const version of most ITK image iterators. A
non-const iterator cannot be instantiated on a non-const image pointer.
Const versions of iterators may read, but may not write pixel values.

Here is a simple example that defines and constructs a simple image iterator
for an \doxygen{otb}{Image}.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  typedef otb::Image<float, 3> ImageType;
  typedef itk::ImageRegionConstIterator< ImageType > ConstIteratorType;
  typedef itk::ImageRegionIterator< ImageType > IteratorType;

  ImageType::Pointer image = SomeFilter->GetOutput();

  ConstIteratorType constIterator( image, image->GetRequestedRegion() );
  IteratorType iterator( image, image->GetRequestedRegion() );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Moving Iterators}
\label{sec:MovingIterators}
An iterator is described as \emph{walking} its iteration region.  At any
time, the iterator will reference, or ``point to'', one pixel location in the
N-dimensional (ND) image.  \emph{Forward iteration} goes from the beginning
of the iteration region to the end of the iteration region.  \emph{Reverse
iteration}, goes from just past the end of the region back to the beginning.
There are two corresponding starting positions for iterators, the
\emph{begin} position and the \emph{end} position.  An iterator can be moved
directly to either of these two positions using the following methods.

\index{forward iteration}
\index{reverse iteration}
\index{iteration region}
\index{Iterators!GoToBegin()}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\code{GoToBegin()}} Points the iterator to the first valid
data element in the region.

\index{Iterators!GoToEnd()}
\item \textbf{\code{GoToEnd()}} Points the iterator to \emph{one position past}
the last valid element in the region.
\end{itemize}

Note that the end position is not actually located within the iteration region.  This is
important to remember because attempting to dereference an iterator at its end
position will have undefined results.

%Moving iteators
ITK iterators are moved back and forth across their iterations using the 
decrement and increment operators.

\index{Iterators!operator++()}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\code{operator++()}} Increments the iterator one position in the
positive direction.  Only the prefix increment operator is defined for ITK image
iterators.

\index{Iterators!operator--}
\item \textbf{\code{operator--()}} Decrements the iterator one position in the
negative direction.  Only the prefix decrement operator is defined for ITK
image iterators. 
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:WalkingIterator} illustrates typical iteration over
an image region.  Most iterators increment and decrement in the direction of
the fastest increasing image dimension, wrapping to the first position in the
next higher dimension at region boundaries.  In other words, an
iterator first moves across columns, then down rows, then from slice to slice,
and so on.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{IteratorFigure1.eps}
\itkcaption[ITK image iteration]{Normal path of an iterator through a 
2D image.  The iteration region is shown in a darker shade.  An arrow denotes
a single iterator step, the result of one \code{++} operation.}
\protect\label{fig:WalkingIterator}
\end{figure}

In addition to sequential iteration through the image, some iterators may define
random access operators.  Unlike the increment operators, random access
operators may not be optimized for speed and require some knowledge of the
dimensionality of the image and the extent of the iteration region to use properly.

\begin{itemize}
\index{Iterators!operator+=()}
\item \textbf{\code{operator+=( OffsetType )}} Moves the iterator to the pixel
position at the current index plus specified \doxygen{itk}{Offset}.

\index{Iterators!operator-=()}
\item \textbf{\code{operator-=( OffsetType )}} Moves the iterator to 
the pixel position at the current index minus specified Offset.

\index{Iterators!SetPosition()}
\item \textbf{\code{SetPosition( IndexType )}} Moves the iterator to the given
\doxygen{itk}{Index} position.
\end{itemize}

The \code{SetPosition()} method may be extremely slow for more complicated
iterator types. In general, it should only be used for setting a starting
iteration position, like you would use \code{GoToBegin()} or \code{GoToEnd()}.

Some iterators do not follow a predictable path through their
iteration regions and have no fixed beginning or ending pixel
locations.  A conditional iterator, for example, visits pixels only if
they have certain values or connectivities.  Random iterators,
increment and decrement to random locations and may even visit a given
pixel location more than once.

%Testing for location
An iterator can be queried to determine if it is at the end or the beginning of
its iteration region. 

\begin{itemize}
\index{Iterators!IsAtEnd()}
\item \textbf{\code{bool IsAtEnd()}} True if the iterator points to \emph{one
position past} the end of the iteration region.

\index{Iterators!IsAtBegin()}
\item \textbf{\code{bool IsAtBegin()}} True if the iterator points to the first
position in the iteration region.  The method is typically used to test for the
end of reverse iteration.

\end{itemize}

An iterator can also report its current image index position.

\begin{itemize}
\index{Iterators!GetIndex()}
\item \textbf{\code{IndexType GetIndex()}} Returns the Index
of the image pixel that the iterator currently points to.
\end{itemize}

% A note on bounds checking
\index{Iterators!and bounds checking}
For efficiency, most ITK image iterators do not perform bounds checking.  It is
possible to move an iterator outside of its valid iteration region.
Dereferencing an out-of-bounds iterator will produce undefined results.

\subsection{Accessing Data}
\label{sec:AccessingData}
ITK image iterators define two basic methods for reading and writing pixel
values.

\begin{itemize}
\index{Iterators!Get()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType Get()}} Returns the value of the pixel at the
iterator position.

\index{Iterators!Set()}
\item \textbf{\code{void Set( PixelType )}} Sets the value of the pixel at the
iterator position.  Not defined for const versions of iterators.
\end{itemize}

% Describe efficiency due to inlining for all cases
The \code{Get()} and \code{Set()} methods are inlined and optimized
for speed so that their use is equivalent to dereferencing the image
buffer directly.  There are a few common cases, however, where using
\code{Get()} and \code{Set()} do incur a penalty. Consider the
following code, which fetches, modifies, and then writes a value back
to the same pixel location.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  it.Set( it.Get() + 1 );
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

As written, this code requires one more memory dereference than is necessary.
Some iterators define a third data access method that avoids this penalty.

\begin{itemize}
\index{Iterators!Value()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType \& Value()}} Returns a reference to the pixel at
the iterator position.
\end{itemize}

The \code{Value()} method can be used as either an lval or an rval in an
expression.  It has all the properties of \code{operator*}.  The
\code{Value()} method makes it possible to rewrite our example code more
efficiently.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  it.Value()++;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Consider using the \code{Value()} method instead of \code{Get()} or
\code{Set()} when a call to \code{operator=} on a pixel is non-trivial, such as
when working with vector pixels, and operations are done in-place in the
image. The disadvantage of using \code{Value} is that it cannot support image
adapters (see Section~\ref{sec:ImageAdaptors} on
page~\pageref{sec:ImageAdaptors} for more information about image adaptors).

\subsection{Iteration Loops}
\label{sec:IterationExample}
% Now give a psuedo code example for putting all of this together.
Using the methods described in the previous sections, we can now write a simple
example to do pixel-wise operations on an image.  The following code calculates
the squares of all values in an input image and writes them to an output image.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  ConstIteratorType in( inputImage,   inputImage->GetRequestedRegion() );
  IteratorType out( outputImage, inputImage->GetRequestedRegion() );

  for ( in.GoToBegin(), out.GoToBegin(); !in.IsAtEnd(); ++in, ++out )
    {
    out.Set( in.Get() * in.Get() );
    }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\index{Iterators!and image regions}
Notice that both the input and output iterators are initialized over the same
region, the \code{RequestedRegion} of \code{inputImage}.  This is good
practice because it ensures that the output iterator walks exactly the same set
of pixel indices as the input iterator, but does not require that the output
and input be the same size. The only requirement is that the input image
must contain a region (a starting index and size) that matches the
\code{RequestedRegion} of the output image.

\index{reverse iteration}
Equivalent code can be written by iterating through the image in reverse.
The syntax is slightly more awkward because the \emph{end} of the
iteration region is not a valid position and we can only test whether the
iterator is strictly \emph{equal} to its beginning position.  It is often more
convenient to write reverse iteration in a \code{while} loop.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  in.GoToEnd();
  out.GoToEnd();
  while ( ! in.IsAtBegin() )
    {
    --in;
    --out;
    out.Set( in.Get() * in.Get() );
    }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{\code{operator==}}
%\item \textbf{\code{operator<}} 
%\item \textbf{\code{operator<=}}
%\item \textbf{\code{operator>}}
%\item \textbf{\code{operator>=}}
%\end{itemize}

\section{Neighborhood Iterators}
\label{sec:NeighborhoodIterators}
\index{Iterators!neighborhood|(}
In ITK, a pixel neighborhood is loosely defined as a small set of pixels that
are locally adjacent to one another in an image.  The size and shape
of a neighborhood, as well the connectivity among pixels in a neighborhood,
may vary with the application.

Many image processing algorithms are neighborhood-based, that is, the result at
a pixel $i$ is computed from the values of pixels in the ND neighborhood of
$i$. Consider finite difference operations in 2D.  A derivative at pixel index
$i = (j, k)$, for example, is taken as a weighted difference of the values
at $(j+1, k)$ and $(j-1, k)$. Other common examples of neighborhood operations
include convolution filtering and image morphology.

This section describes a class of ITK image iterators that are designed for
working with pixel neighborhoods. An ITK neighborhood iterator walks an image
region just like a normal image iterator, but instead of only referencing a
single pixel at each step, it simultaneously points to the entire ND
neighborhood of pixels.  Extensions to the standard iterator interface provide
read and write access to all neighborhood pixels and information
such as the size, extent, and location of the neighborhood.

Neighborhood iterators use the same operators defined in
Section~\ref{sec:IteratorsInterface} and the same code constructs as normal
iterators for looping through an
image. Figure~\ref{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig1} shows a neighborhood iterator
moving through an iteration region.  This iterator defines a $3x3$ neighborhood
around each pixel that it visits. The \emph{center} of the neighborhood
iterator is always positioned over its current index and all other neighborhood
pixel indices are referenced as offsets from the center index.  The pixel
under the center of the neighborhood iterator and all pixels under the shaded
area, or \emph{extent}, of the iterator can be dereferenced.



\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{NeighborhoodIteratorFig1.eps}
\itkcaption[Neighborhood iterator]{Path of a $3x3$ neighborhood
iterator through a 2D image region.  The extent of the neighborhood is

this extent are accessible through the iterator.  An arrow denotes a single
iterator step, the result of one \code{++} operation.}
\protect\label{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig1}
\end{figure}

\index{Neighborhood iterators!construction of}
\index{Neighborhood iterators!radius of}

In addition to the standard image pointer and iteration region
(Section~\ref{sec:IteratorsInterface}), neighborhood iterator constructors
require an argument that specifies the extent of the neighborhood to cover.
Neighborhood extent is symmetric across its center in each
axis and is given as an array of $N$ distances that are collectively called the
\emph{radius}. Each element $d$ of the radius, where $0 < d < N$ and
$N$ is the dimensionality of the neighborhood, gives the extent of the
neighborhood in pixels for dimension $N$.  The length of each face of the
resulting ND hypercube is $2d + 1$ pixels, a distance of $d$ on either side of
the single pixel at the neighbor center.
Figure~{\ref{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig2} shows the relationship between the
radius of the iterator and the size of the neighborhood for a variety of 2D
iterator shapes.

The radius of the neighborhood iterator is queried after construction
by calling the \code{GetRadius()} method.  Some other methods provide
some useful information about the iterator and its underlying image.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{NeighborhoodIteratorFig2.eps}
\itkcaption[Some possible neighborhood iterator shapes]{Several possible 2D
neighborhood iterator shapes are shown along with their radii and sizes.  A
neighborhood pixel can be dereferenced by its integer index (top) or its
offset from the center (bottom).  The center pixel of each iterator is
shaded.}
\protect\label{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig2}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetRadius()}
\item \textbf{\code{SizeType GetRadius()}} Returns the ND radius of the
neighborhood as an \doxygen{itk}{Size}.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetImagePointer()}
\item \textbf{\code{const ImageType *GetImagePointer()}} Returns the pointer to
the image referenced by the iterator.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!Size()}
\item \textbf{\code{unsigned long Size()}} Returns the size in number of 
pixels of the neighborhood.

\end{itemize}

The neighborhood iterator interface extends the normal ITK iterator interface
for setting and getting pixel values.  One way to dereference pixels is to
think of the neighborhood as a linear array where each pixel has a unique
integer index. The index of a pixel in the array is determined by incrementing
from the upper-left-forward corner of the neighborhood along the fastest
increasing image dimension: first column, then row, then slice, and so on.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig2}, the unique integer index is shown
at the top of each pixel.  The center pixel is always at position $n/2$, where
$n$ is the size of the array.

\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetPixel(const unsigned int i)}} Returns the 
value of the pixel at neighborhood position \code{i}.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetPixel(const unsigned int i, PixelType p)}} 
Sets the value of the pixel at position \code{i} to \code{p}.

\end{itemize}

Another way to think about a pixel location in a neighborhood is as an
ND offset from the neighborhood center.  The upper-left-forward corner
of a $3x3x3$ neighborhood, for example, can be described by offset
$(-1, -1, -1)$.  The bottom-right-back corner of the same neighborhood
is at offset $(1, 1, 1)$.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig2}, the offset from center is
shown at the bottom of each neighborhood pixel.

\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetPixel(const OffsetType \&o)}} Get the value of
the pixel at the position offset \code{o} from the neighborhood center.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetPixel(const OffsetType \&o, PixelType p)}} Set
the value at the position offset \code{o} from the neighborhood center to
the value \code{p}.

\end{itemize}

The neighborhood iterators also provide a shorthand for setting and getting the
value at the center of the neighborhood.

\index{NeighborhoodIterators!}
\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetCenterPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetCenterPixel()}} Gets the value at the center
of the neighborhood.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetCenterPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetCenterPixel(PixelType p)}} Sets the value at the
center of the neighborhood to the value \code{p}

\end{itemize}

There is another shorthand for setting and getting values for pixels that
lie some integer distance from the neighborhood center along one of the image
axes.

\index{NeighborhoodIterators!}
\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetNext()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetNext(unsigned int d)}} Get the value
immediately adjacent to the neighborhood center in the positive direction along
the \code{d} axis.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetNext()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetNext(unsigned int d, PixelType p)}} Set the value
immediately adjacent to the neighborhood center in the positive direction along
the \code{d} axis to the value \code{p}.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetPrevious()}
\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetPrevious(unsigned int d)}} Get the value
immediately adjacent to the neighborhood center in the negative direction along
the \code{d} axis.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetPrevious()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetPrevious(unsigned int d, PixelType p)}}
Set the value immediately adjacent to the neighborhood center in the
negative direction along the \code{d} axis to the value \code{p}.

\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetNext(unsigned int d, unsigned int
s)}} Get the value of the pixel located \code{s} pixels from the
neighborhood center in the positive direction along the \code{d} axis.

\item \textbf{\code{void SetNext(unsigned int d, unsigned int s, PixelType p)}}
Set the value of the pixel located \code{s} pixels from the neighborhood center
in the positive direction along the \code{d} axis to value \code{p}.

\item \textbf{\code{PixelType GetPrevious(unsigned int d, unsigned int
s)}} Get the value of the pixel located \code{s} pixels from the
neighborhood center in the positive direction along the \code{d} axis.
 
\item \textbf{\code{void SetPrevious(unsigned int d, unsigned int s,
PixelType p)}} Set the value of the pixel located \code{s} pixels from
the neighborhood center in the positive direction along the \code{d}
axis to value \code{p}.

\end{itemize}

It is also possible to extract or set all of the neighborhood values
from an iterator at once using a regular ITK neighborhood object.
This may be useful in algorithms that perform a particularly large
number of calculations in the neighborhood and would otherwise require
multiple dereferences of the same pixels.

\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetNeighborhood()}
\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetNeighborhood()}
\item \textbf{\code{NeighborhoodType GetNeighborhood()}} Return a
\doxygen{itk}{Neighborhood} of the same size and shape as the neighborhood
iterator and contains all of the values at the iterator position.

\item \textbf{\code{void SetNeighborhood(NeighborhoodType \&N)}} Set all
of the values in the neighborhood at the iterator position to those contained
in Neighborhood \code{N}, which must be the same size and shape as the
iterator.

\end{itemize}

Several methods are defined to provide information about the neighborhood.

\index{NeighborhoodIterators!}
\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetIndex()}
\item \textbf{\code{IndexType GetIndex()}} Return the image
index of the center pixel of the neighborhood iterator.

\item \textbf{\code{IndexType GetIndex(OffsetType o)}} Return the
image index of the pixel at offset \code{o} from the neighborhood 
center.

\item \textbf{\code{IndexType GetIndex(unsigned int i)}} Return the
image index of the pixel at array position \code{i}.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetOffset()}
\item \textbf{\code{OffsetType GetOffset(unsigned int i)}}  Return the offset
from the neighborhood center of the pixel at array position \code{i}.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetNeighborhoodIndex()}
\item \textbf{\code{unsigned long GetNeighborhoodIndex(OffsetType o)}}
Return the array position of the pixel at offset \code{o} from the
neighborhood center.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!GetSlice()}
\item \textbf{\code{std::slice GetSlice(unsigned int n)}} Return a
\code{std::slice} through the iterator neighborhood along axis \code{n}.

\end{itemize}

\index{Neighborhood iterators!boundary conditions}
\index{Neighborhood iterators!bounds checking}
A neighborhood-based calculation in a neighborhood close to an image
boundary may require data that falls outside the boundary.  The
iterator in Figure~\ref{fig:NeighborhoodIteratorFig1}, for example, is
centered on a boundary pixel such that three of its neighbors actually
do not exist in the image.  When the extent of a neighborhood falls
outside the image, pixel values for missing neighbors are supplied
according to a rule, usually chosen to satisfy the numerical
requirements of the algorithm.  A rule for supplying out-of-bounds
values is called a \emph{boundary condition}.
 
ITK neighborhood iterators automatically detect out-of-bounds dereferences and
will return values according to boundary conditions.  The boundary condition
type is specified by the second, optional template parameter of the iterator.
By default, neighborhood iterators use a Neumann condition where the first
derivative across the boundary is zero.  The Neumann rule simply returns the
closest in-bounds pixel value to the requested out-of-bounds location.  Several
other common boundary conditions can be found in the ITK toolkit.  They include
a periodic condition that returns the pixel value from the opposite side of the
data set, and is useful when working with periodic data such as Fourier
transforms, and a constant value condition that returns a set value $v$ for all
out-of-bounds pixel dereferences.  The constant value condition is equivalent
to padding the image with value $v$.

Bounds checking is a computationally expensive operation because it occurs each
time the iterator is incremented.  To increase efficiency, a neighborhood
iterator automatically disables bounds checking when it detects that it is
not necessary.  A user may also explicitly disable or enable bounds checking.
Most neighborhood based algorithms can minimize the need for bounds checking
through clever definition of iteration regions.  These techniques are explored
in Section~\ref{sec:NeighborhoodExample3}.

\begin{itemize}

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!NeedToUseBoundaryConditionOn()}
\item \textbf{\code{void NeedToUseBoundaryConditionOn()}} Explicitly turn
bounds checking on.  This method should be used with caution because
unnecessarily enabling bounds checking may result in a significant performance
decrease. In general you should allow the iterator to automatically determine
this setting.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!NeedToUseBoundaryConditionOff()}
\item \textbf{\code{void NeedToUseBoundaryConditionOff()}} Explicitly disable
bounds checking. This method should be used with caution because disabling
bounds checking when it is needed will result in out-of-bounds reads and
undefined results.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!OverrideBoundaryCondition()}
\item \textbf{\code{void OverrideBoundaryCondition(BoundaryConditionType *b)}} 
Overrides the templated boundary condition, using boundary condition
object \code{b} instead. Object \code{b} should not be deleted until
it has been released by the iterator.  This method can be used to
change iterator behavior at run-time.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!ResetBoundaryCondition()}
\item \textbf{\code{void ResetBoundaryCondition()}} Discontinues the use of any
run-time specified boundary condition and returns to using the condition
specified in the template argument.

\index{NeighborhoodIterator!SetPixel()}
\item \textbf{\code{void SetPixel(unsigned int i, PixelType p, bool
status)}} Sets the value at neighborhood array position \code{i} to value
\code{p}.  If the position \code{i} is out-of-bounds, \code{status} is set to
\code{false}, otherwise \code{status} is set to \code{true}.

The following sections describe the two ITK neighborhood iterator classes,
\doxygen{itk}{NeighborhoodIterator} and \doxygen{itk}{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator}.
Each has a const and a non-const version.  The shaped iterator is a refinement
of the standard NeighborhoodIterator that supports an
arbitrarily-shaped (non-rectilinear) neighborhood.

The standard neighborhood iterator class in ITK is the
\doxygen{itk}{NeighborhoodIterator}.  Together with its \code{const} version,
\doxygen{itk}{ConstNeighborhoodIterator}, it implements the complete API
described above.  This section provides several examples to illustrate the use
of NeighborhoodIterator.

\subsection{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator}
\label{sec:itkShapedNeighborhoodIterator}
\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator}
\index{Neighborhood iterators!shaped}
\index{Neighborhood iterators!as stencils}
This section describes a variation on the neighborhood iterator called a
\emph{shaped} neighborhood iterator.  A shaped neighborhood is defined like
a bit mask, or \emph{stencil}, with different offsets in the rectilinear
neighborhood of the normal neighborhood iterator turned off or on to create a
pattern.  Inactive positions (those not in the stencil) are not updated during
iteration and their values cannot be read or written.  The shaped iterator is
implemented in the class \doxygen{itk}{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator}, which is a
subclass of
\doxygen{itk}{NeighborhoodIterator}.  A const version,
\doxygen{itk}{ConstShapedNeighborhoodIterator}, is also available.

\index{Neighborhood iterators!active neighbors}
\index{Neighborhood iterators!inactive neighbors}
Like a regular neighborhood iterator, a shaped neighborhood iterator must be
initialized with an ND radius object, but the radius of the neighborhood of a
shaped iterator only defines the set of \emph{possible} neighbors.  Any number
of possible neighbors can then be activated or deactivated.  The shaped
neighborhood iterator defines an API for activating neighbors.  When a neighbor
location, defined relative to the center of the neighborhood, is activated, it
is placed on the \emph{active list} and is then part of the stencil.  An
iterator can be ``reshaped'' at any time by adding or removing offsets from the
active list.

\begin{itemize}

\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!ActivateOffset()}
\item \textbf{\code{void ActivateOffset(OffsetType \&o)}} Include the offset
\code{o} in the stencil of active neighborhood positions.  Offsets are relative
to the neighborhood center.

\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!DeactivateOffset()}
\item \textbf{\code{void DeactivateOffset(OffsetType \&o)}} Remove the offset
\code{o} from the stencil of active neighborhood positions.  Offsets are
relative to the neighborhood center. 

\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!ClearActiveList()}
\item \textbf{\code{void ClearActiveList()}} Deactivate all positions in the
iterator stencil by clearing the active list.

\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!GetActiveIndexListSize()}
\item \textbf{\code{unsigned int GetActiveIndexListSize()}} Return the number
of pixel locations that are currently active in the shaped iterator stencil.

\end{itemize}

Because the neighborhood is less rigidly defined in the shaped iterator, the
set of pixel access methods is restricted.  Only the \code{GetPixel()} and
\code{SetPixel()} methods are available, and calling these methods on an 
inactive neighborhood offset will return undefined results.

For the common case of traversing all pixel offsets in a neighborhood, the
shaped iterator class provides an iterator through the active offsets in its
stencil.   This \emph{stencil iterator} can be incremented or decremented and
defines \code{Get()} and \code{Set()} for reading and writing the values in the
neighborhood.

\begin{itemize}
\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!Iterator::Begin()}
\item \textbf{\code{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator::Iterator Begin()}} Return a
const or non-const iterator through the shaped iterator stencil that points to
the first valid location in the stencil.

\index{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator!Iterator::End()}
\item \textbf{\code{ShapedNeighborhoodIterator::Iterator End()}} Return a
const or non-const iterator through the shaped iterator stencil that points
\emph{one position past} the last valid location in the stencil.
\end{itemize}

The functionality and interface of the shaped neighborhood iterator is best
described by example.  We will use the ShapedNeighborhoodIterator to
implement some binary image morphology algorithms (see \cite{Gonzalez1993},
\cite{Castleman1996}, et al.).  The examples that follow implement erosion and
dilation.
