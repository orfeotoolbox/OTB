\chapter{Compiling OTB from source}
\label{chapter:Installation}
\index{Installation}

There are two ways to install OTB library on your system: installing from a binary distribution or compiling from sources. 
You can find information about the installation of binary packages for OTB and Monteverdi in the OTB-Cookbook.
This chapter covers installation from sources, also known as compiling.

OTB has been developed and tested across different combinations of operating systems, compilers, and hardware platforms including MS-Windows, Linux on Intel-compatible hardware and Mac OSX.  It is known to work with the following compilers in 32/64 bit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Visual Studio 2010 and higher compiler on MS-Windows
\item GCC 4.1 and higher on Unix/Linux systems
\item Clang on MacOSX (10.8 and higher) systems
\end{itemize}

\index{CMake}
The challenge of supporting OTB across platforms has been solved through the use of CMake, a cross-platform, open-source
build system. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
configuration files.  CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of
your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it supports complex environments requiring system configuration, compiler
feature testing, and code generation.

CMake supports several generators to produce the compilation scripts, dependending on the platform and compiler. It can use :
\begin{itemize}
\item Makefiles for Unix systems
\item Visual Studio workspaces for Windows
\item NMake Makefiles for Windows
\item Ninja scripts
\item and many more ...
\end{itemize}
The information used by CMake is provided by \code{CMakeLists.txt} files that
are present in every directory of the OTB source tree. These files contain information that the user provides to CMake
at configuration time. Typical information includes paths to utilities in the system and the selection of software
options specified by the user.

There are (at least) two ways to use CMake :
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the command \texttt{ccmake} (on Unix) or \texttt{cmake-gui} (on Windows): 
it provides an interactive mode in which you iteratively select
options and configure according to these options. The iteration
proceeds until no more options remain to be selected. At this point, a
generation step produces the appropriate build files for your
configuration. This is the easiest way to start.
\item Using the command \texttt{cmake} : it is a non-interactive polyvalent tool designed for scripting. It can run both \textit{configure} and \textit{generate} steps.
\end{itemize}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:CMakeGUI}, CMake has a different interfaces according to your system.
Refer to section~\ref{sec:compiling-linux} for Linux build instructions, 
\ref{sec:compiling-macosx} for Mac~OS~X,
and \ref{sec:compiling-windows} for Windows.

\index{Dependencies}
OTB depends on a number of external libraries.
Some are mandatory, meaning that OTB cannot be compiled without them, while others are optional and can be activated or
not during the build process.
See table \ref{tab:otb-dependencies} for the full list of dependencies.

\subsection{Setting up the build environment}

The first thing to do is to create a directory for working with OTB.
This guide will use \texttt{$\sim$/OTB} but you are free to choose something else.
In this directory, there will be three locations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{$\sim$/OTB/otb} for the source file obtained from the git repository
\item \texttt{$\sim$/OTB/build} for the intermediate build objects, CMake specific files, libraries and binaries.
\item \texttt{$\sim$/OTB/install}, the installation directory for OTB once it is built.
A system location (\texttt{/usr/local} for example) can also be used, but installing locally is more flexible and does
not require root access.
\end{itemize}
To setup this structure, the following commands can be used:
\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir ~/OTB
$ cd ~/OTB
$ git clone https://git@git.orfeo-toolbox.org/git/otb.git
$ mkdir build
$ mkdir install
\end{verbatim}

The OTB project uses a git branching model where \texttt{develop} is the current development version.
It contains the latest patches and represents the work in progress towards the next release.
For more information on OTB and git, including how to decide which branch to want to compile, please see the
OTB wiki page at \url{http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Git}.

Checkout the relevant branch now:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/OTB/otb
$ git checkout develop
\end{verbatim}

Now you must decide which build method you will use.
There are two ways of compiling OTB from sources, depending on how you want to manage dependencies.
Both methods rely on CMake.
\begin{itemize}
\item SuperBuild (go to section~\ref{sec:installation-linux-superbuild}). All OTB dependencies are automatically downloaded and compiled.
This method is the easiest to use and provides a complete OTB with minimal effort.
\item Normal build (go to section~\ref{sec:installation-linux-normalbuild}). OTB dependencies must already be compiled and available on your system.
This method requires more work but provides more flexibility.
\end{itemize}
If you do not know which method to use and just want to compile OTB with all its modules, use SuperBuild.

\subsection{SuperBuild: Build OTB and all dependencies}
\label{sec:installation-linux-superbuild}

The SuperBuild is a way of compiling dependencies to a project just before you build the project. Thanks to CMake and
its ExternalProject module, it is possible to download a source archive, configure, compile and install it when building
the main project. This feature has been used in other CMake-based projects (ITK, Slicer, ParaView,...).
In OTB, the SuperBuild is implemented with no impact on the library sources : the sources for SuperBuild are located in
the 'OTB/SuperBuild' subdirectory. It is made of CMake scripts and source patches that allow to compile all the
dependencies necessary for OTB. Once all the dependencies are compiled and installed, the OTB library is built using
those dependencies.

OTB's compilation is customized by specifying configuration variables.
The most important configuration variables are shown in table~\ref{tab:installation-cmake-variables}.
The simplest way to provide configuration variables is via the command line \texttt{-D} option:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/OTB/build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCATION=~/OTB/install ../otb/SuperBuild
\end{verbatim}
A pre-load script can also be used with the \texttt{-C} options (see
\url{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/manual/cmake.1.html#options}).
Another option is to set variables manually with \texttt{cmake-gui} or \texttt{ccmake}.

During the configuration step, the SuperBuild will detect any existing dependencies installed as systems libraries.
Wheter to use them can be controlled via the \texttt{USE\_SYSTEM\_\textit{XXX}} (see
table~\ref{tab:installation-cmake-variables}).

SuperBuild downloads dependencies into the \texttt{DOWNLOAD\_LOCATION} directory, which will be
\texttt{$\sim$/OTB/build/Downloads} in our example.
Dependencies can be downloaded manually into this directory before the compilation step.
This can be usefull if you wish to bypass a proxy, intend to compile OTB without an internet conection, or other network
constraint. You can find a complete bundle with all dependencies sources on the Orfeo ToolBox website (pick the 'SuperBuild-archives' corresponding to the OTB version you want to build) :
\begin{center}
\url{https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/packages}
\end{center}

You are now ready to compile OTB!
Simply use the make command (other targets can be generated with CMake's \texttt{-G} option):
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/OTB/build
$ make
\end{verbatim}

The installation target will copy the binaries and libraries to the installation location:
\begin{verbatim}
$ make install
\end{verbatim}

A wiki page detailing the status of SuperBuild on various platforms is also available here:
\url{http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/SuperBuild}.

\subsection{Normal build: Build only OTB}
\label{sec:installation-linux-normalbuild}

Once all OTB dependencies are availables on your system, use CMake to generate a Makefile:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/OTB/build
$ cmake -C configuration.cmake ../otb
\end{verbatim}
The script \texttt{configuration.cmake} needs to contain dependencies location if CMake cannot find them automatically.
This can be done with the \texttt{\textit{XXX}\_DIR} variables containing the directories which contain the
FindXXX.cmake scripts, or with the \texttt{\textit{XXX}\_INCLUDEDIR} and \texttt{\textit{XXX}\_LIBRARY} variables.

Additionally, decide which module you wish to enable, together with tests and examples.
Refer to table~\ref{tab:installation-cmake-variables} for the list of CMake variables.

Since OTB is modularized, it is possible to only build some modules instead of the whole set. 
To deactivate a module (and the ones that depend on it) switch off the CMake variable OTB\_BUILD\_DEFAULT\_MODULES,
configure, and then switch off each \texttt{Module\_module\_name} variable.
To provide an overview on how things work, the option \texttt{COMPONENTS} of the CMake command find\_package is used in
order to only load the requested modules.
This module-specific list prevent CMake from performing a blind search; it is also a convienent way to monitor the
dependencies of each module.
\begin{verbatim}
find_package(OTB COMPONENTS OTBCommon OTBTransform [...])
\end{verbatim} 

Some of the OTB capabilities are considered as optional, and you can deactivate the related modules thanks to a set of
CMake variables starting with \texttt{OTB\_USE\_\textit{XXX}}.
Table~\ref{tab:optional} shows which modules are associated to these variables. It is very important to notice that
these variable override the variable OTB\_BUILD\_DEFAULT\_MODULES.

You are now ready to compile OTB!
Simply use the make command (other targets can be generated with CMake's \texttt{-G} option):
\begin{verbatim}
$ make
\end{verbatim}

The installation target will copy the binaries and libraries to the installation location:
\begin{verbatim}
$ make install
\end{verbatim}

\section{Windows}
\label{sec:compiling-windows}

Everything that is needed for OTB development on Windows, including compiling from source, is covered in details on the OTB wiki at:

\end{center}

\section{Known issues}
\label{sec:knownissues}

\begin{itemize}
\item  openjpeg/ITK 
\end{itemize}

It is important to know that the OpenJpeg library doesn't support name mangling since version 2.0. 
As a consequence, if other libraries linked by your project already contain OpenJpeg, there may be a symbol conflict at run-time. 
For instance, this was observed with OTB build on a recent ITK version (ver. 4). 
The ITK library already had a version of OpenJpeg in libitkopenjpeg-*.so, which contained the OpenJpeg symbols un-wrapped.
These symbols were also loaded by the GDAL driver but only the first ones were used, which caused a crash. 

Hopefully, thanks to the modular architecture of ITK, the library libitkopenjpeg-*.so is not imported anymore inside OTB.
However the OpenJPEG headers may be present in ITK include directory. As the current architecture doesn't allow to tune 
include order between modules, the OpenJPEG header from ITK can be included before your own OpenJPEG install. There are
two ways to avoid this situation :
\begin{itemize}
\item Use an ITK without GDCM nor ITKReview (only these modules depend on OpenJPEG)
\item Hide the header openjpeg.h in the ITK include directory.
\end{itemize}

More information can be found here : \url{http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/JPEG2000_with_GDAL_OpenJpeg_plugin}

\begin{itemize}
\item  libkml / Ubuntu 12.04 
\end{itemize}

Another issue is related to the official package of libkml under Ubuntu 12.4.
Until this problem is addressed, users of this plateform should disable the option OTB\_USE\_KML, so that OTB won't be built with this third-party.
