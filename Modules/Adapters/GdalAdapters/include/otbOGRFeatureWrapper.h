 * It provides an encapsulation of OGR classes. In that particular case, it's an
 * encapsulation of \c OGRFeature.
 *
 * \note This class is a proxy class on top of an \c OGRLayer.
 * \note It can be copied, and assigned. New instances will share the underlying
 * \c OGRLayer: \c Feature assignment will just make one \c Feature proxy point
 * to another \c OGRFeature. In order to truly assign from one to another, use
 * \c SetFrom, or \c Clone in order to duplicate the current feature.
 * \note The default constructor is disabled on purpose.
 * \note The destructor automatically generated does everything that is
 * expected.
 * \invariant <tt>m_Feature != 0</tt> Actually, this isn't a true invariant per
 * se, as it may be null in some cases, for instance to define mark the \c
 * Layer::end() iterator.
 * \since OTB v 3.14.0
