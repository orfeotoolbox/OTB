/**
 * \class RelabelComponentImageFilter
 * \brief Relabel the components in an image such that consecutive labels are used.
 *
 * RelabelComponentImageFilter remaps the labels associated with the
 * objects in an image (as from the output of
 * ConnectedComponentImageFilter) such that the label numbers are
 * consecutive with no gaps between the label numbers used.  By
 * default, the relabeling will also sort the labels based on the size
 * of the object: the largest object will have label #1, the second
 * largest will have label #2, etc.
 *
 * Label #0 is assumed to be background is left unaltered by the
 * relabeling.
 *
 * RelabelComponentImageFilter is typically used on the output of the
 * ConnectedComponentImageFilter for those applications that want to
 * extract the largest object or the "k" largest objects. Any
 * particular object can be extracted from the relabeled output using
 * a BinaryThresholdImageFilter. A group of objects can be extracted
 * from the relabled output using a ThresholdImageFilter.
 *
 * Once all the objects are relabeled, the application can query the
 * number of objects and the size of each object. Object sizes are
 * returned in a vector. The size of the background is not
 * calculated. So the size of object #1 is
 * GetSizeOfObjectsInPixels()[0], the size of object #2 is
 * GetSizeOfObjectsInPixels()[1], etc.
 *
 * If user sets a minimum object size, all objects with fewer pixelss
 * than the minimum will be discarded, so that the number of objects
 * reported will be only those remaining. The
 * GetOriginalNumberOfObjects method can be called to find out how
 * many objects were present before the small ones were discarded.
 *
 * RelabelComponentImageFilter can be run as an "in place" filter,
 * where it will overwrite its output.  The default is run out of
 * place (or generate a separate output).  "In place" operation can be
 * controlled via methods in the superclass,
 * InPlaceImageFilter::InPlaceOn() and InPlaceImageFilter::InPlaceOff().
