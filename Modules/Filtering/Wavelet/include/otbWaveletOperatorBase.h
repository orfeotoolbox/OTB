/**
 * \class WaveletOperatorBase
 *
 * \brief A NeighborhoodOperator wavelet base class
 *
 * This class is the mother class for any wavelet operator that requires
 * "a-trou" approach for shift-invariant wavelet transform. This class has
 * to be derived, it cannot be used directly since GenerateCoefficients() method
 * is still pure virtual.
 *
 * Any wavelet operator that inherits from this WaveletOperatorBase is to be used
 * as a NeighborhoodOperator that should be applied to a
 * NeighborhoodIterator using the NeighborhoodInnerProduct method.
 *
 * It is assumed that any wavelet definition is directional.
 *
 * Set the level of up-sampling though SetUpSampleFactor() before calling
 * CreateDirectional(). Each class that inherits from WaveletOperatorBase has
 * to re-implement GenerateCoefficients().
 *
 * The name of the wavelet is defined here but left pure virtual. It is defined
 * with the LowPass and HighPass inheritance.
