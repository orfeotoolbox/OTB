/** \class RadiometryHomogenousWithNeighborhoodDataNodeFeatureFunction
  * \brief Compute the spectral angle between the radiometry along
  * a line and its neighborhood
  *
  * This function compares the radiometry along a datanode with the
  * radiometry of the neighborhood.
  *
  * It computes the mean of a rectangular area around each line segment,
  * and the mean of two rectangular areas on each side of the line segment.
  * The descriptor is the spectral angle between the two values,
  * scaled by \$f\pi\$f.
  *
  * The width of the area around a line segment can be specified with
  * SetCenterRadius.
  *
  * The neighborhood area can be specified by two radius, using SetNeighborhoodBeginRadius
  * and SetNeighborhoodEndRadius.
