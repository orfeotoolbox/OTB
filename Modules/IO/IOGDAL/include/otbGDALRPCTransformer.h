/**
 * \class GDALRPCTransformer
 * \brief This class is a wrapper around GDALCreateRPCTransformer and GDALRPCTransform
 *
 * This class aims at manipulating RPC transformations within OTB,
 * in a safe and easy way.
 *
 * To use this wrapper, one needs to call the constructor with the correct
 * parameters. Then, one can set the options, and the threshold. Finally,
 * one can call ForwardTransform or BackwardTransform, depending in the
 * desired result.
 *
 * The parameters provided to the constructor are those found in the
 * RPCParam structure defined in the otbGeometryMetadata.h file. They
 * are quite similar to what can be found in GDALRPCInfo.

   * Set additional options to the transformer
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li> RPC_HEIGHT: a fixed height offset to be applied to all points passed
   * in.  In this situation the Z passed into the transformation function is
   * assumed to be height above ground, and the RPC_HEIGHT is assumed to be
   * an average height above sea level for ground in the target scene.</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_HEIGHT_SCALE: a factor used to multiply heights above ground.
   * Useful when elevation offsets of the DEM are not expressed in meters.</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_DEM: the name of a GDAL dataset (a DEM file typically) used to
   * extract elevation offsets from. In this situation the Z passed into the
   * transformation function is assumed to be height above ground. This option
   * should be used in replacement of RPC_HEIGHT to provide a way of defining
   * a non uniform ground for the target scene</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_DEMINTERPOLATION: the DEM interpolation ("near", "bilinear" or "cubic").
   *      Default is "bilinear".</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_DEM_MISSING_VALUE: value of DEM height that must be used in case
   * the DEM has nodata value at the sampling point, or if its extent does not
   * cover the requested coordinate. When not specified, missing values will cause
   * a failed transform.</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_DEM_SRS: (GDAL >= 3.2) WKT SRS, or any string recognized by
   * OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput(), to be used as an override for DEM SRS.
   * Useful if DEM SRS does not have an explicit vertical component. </li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_DEM_APPLY_VDATUM_SHIFT: whether the vertical component of a compound
   * SRS for the DEM should be used (when it is present). This is useful so as to
   * be able to transform the "raw" values from the DEM expressed with respect to
   * a geoid to the heights with respect to the WGS84 ellipsoid. When this is
   * enabled, the GTIFF_REPORT_COMPD_CS configuration option will be also set
   * temporarily so as to get the vertical information from GeoTIFF
   * files. Defaults to TRUE. (GDAL >= 2.1.0)</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_PIXEL_ERROR_THRESHOLD: overrides the dfPixErrThreshold parameter, ie
   * the error (measured in pixels) allowed in the
   * iterative solution of pixel/line to lat/long computations (the other way
   * is always exact given the equations).  (GDAL >= 2.1.0)</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_MAX_ITERATIONS: maximum number of iterations allowed in the
   * iterative solution of pixel/line to lat/long computations. Default value is
   * 10 in the absence of a DEM, or 20 if there is a DEM.  (GDAL >= 2.1.0)</li>
   *
   * <li> RPC_FOOTPRINT: WKT or GeoJSON polygon (in long / lat coordinate space)
   * with a validity footprint for the RPC. Any coordinate transformation that
   * goes from or arrive outside this footprint will be considered invalid. This
   * is useful in situations where the RPC values become highly unstable outside
   * of the area on which they have been computed for, potentially leading to
   * undesirable "echoes" / false positives. This requires GDAL to be built against
   * GEOS.</li>
   * </ul>

   * \param[in] Value a string containing the value of the option
