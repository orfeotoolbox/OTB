otb_fetch_module(otbGRM
  "This module provides the GRM OTB application to perform multiscale
region-merging segmentation on satellite images. Three local homogeneity
criteria are available: the Baatz & Sch√§pe criterion, the Full Lambda Schedule
criterion and the simple Euclidean Distance criterion.  This application uses
the GRM (Generic Region Merging) library which allows quickly adding a new local
homogeneity criterion. Look at the template header file: GRMSegmenterTemplate.h
to see which format you must respect to add a new criterion.

A more detailed description can be found on the project website:
