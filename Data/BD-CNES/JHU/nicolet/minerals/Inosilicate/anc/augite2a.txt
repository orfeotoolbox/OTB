Mineral:  Augite (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al,Ti)(Si,Al)2O6

File Name:  Augite2a.txt

XRD Analysis:  The sample was augite plus a moderate amount of 
dolomite. After treatment with warm HCl to remove dolomite, the 
sample appeared to be pure augite.

Chemistry:  Microprobe analysis showed the sample to be 
homogeneous within and between grains.  The sample could be 
classified as "ferroan augite."  It has relatively high alumina, iron and 
soda, and low calcium.  Analysis indicates WO34, EN45, FS21 
composition.  Average of 10 analyses:
