Weak fine granular structure, very friable. 0.37% organic carbon, 2.4% clay, 
7.4% silt, 90.2% sand.

Clay mineralogy: none.

Coarse mineralogy: 85% quartz, 10% weathered aggregates, 2% plagioclase 
feldspar, 1% potassic feldspar, 1% microcline, 1% tourmaline and traces of 
talc.

Spectral description: The short wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 micron 
hydroxyl band, the weak 2.35 and 2.39 micron features, the sharp 2.71 and 
2.76 micron bands with weak features near 2.73 and 2.74 microns between 
them, all are consistent with the presence of significant kaolinite.  The weak 
bands near 2.84, 2.90 and 2.95 microns indicate a relatively small amount of 
gibbsite.  Weak HC absorption bands near 3.4 and 3.5 microns are 
accompanied by a broad, weak hydrocarbon band near 2.50 microns.  Quartz 
combination tone bands indicate by their relative intensities, especially that 
of the strong 4.47 micron band and the weaker features to shorter 
wavelength, the coarse particle size of the quartz grains.  This grain size also 
results in a very strong quartz reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 
microns.  The curvature of the short wavelength side of this doublet toward 
the band gap indicates some self-absorption by microcrystalline quartz in the 
clay coating.  However, the lower relative height of the long wavelength side 
indicates still stronger absorption by kaolinite in the grain coating, which 
also inverts the normal peak of this feature into a weak trough near 8.98 
microns.  The lack of any significant feldspar contribution is indicated by the 
narrowness of the quartz reststrahlen doublet and the smooth falloff in 
reflectance to the alpha quartz doublet near 12.6 microns.
