Weak fine granular structure , soft and very friable, nonsticky and non 
plastic, neutral pH (7.2).  1.15% organic carbon; 6.4% clay; 45.0% silt; 
48.6% sand.

Clay mineralogy: small mica, kaolinite and montmorillonite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 67% quartz, 17% potassic feldspar, 7% glass, 3% 
opaque, 2% other, 2% amphibole, 1% biotite, 1% plagioclase feldspar, and 
traces of zircon, garnet, muscovite, plant opal, pyroxene, and calcite.

Spectral Description:  The long wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 microns 
hydroxyl band in the near infrared, the weakness of the 2.71 micron kaolinite 
hydroxyl band, and the strength and breadth of the 2.76 micron hydroxyl 
band all indicate that montmorillonite is spectrally dominant in the hydroxyl 
region.  Barely discernible H-C bands near 3.4 and 3.5 microns and a very 
weak, broad minimum near 2.5 microns are consistent with the very low 
organic content of this soil.  The relative intensities of the quartz 
combination tone bands superimposed on the primary volume scattering 
reflectance peak, especially the appearance of the weak features near 3.73, 
3.85 and 4.00 microns and the strong expression of the 4.47 and 4.68 
microns features, indicates a very coarse particle size for the quartz.  The 
quartz reststrahlen doublet is strongly expressed between 7.7 and 9.7 
microns, with a K-feldspar reststrahlen peak near 9.28 microns and weak 
side bands to longer wavelength superimposed on it.  Despite the small 
amount of kaolinite present, it effectively coats the quartz grains, resulting in 
the marked shortening of the long wavelength side of the quartz reststrahlen 
doublet and the inversion of its peak due to kaolinite absorption.
