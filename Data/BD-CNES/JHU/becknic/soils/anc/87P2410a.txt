Moderate to coarse prismatic structure, very hard and friable with neutral pH 
(6.5).  0.71% organic carbon; 12.2% clay; 25.4% silt; 62.4% sand.

Clay mineralogy: medium mica peak, small mt and kk peaks, and weak 
quartz peak.

Coarse mineralogy (B horizon at 106 cm): 51% quartz, 31% potassic 
feldspar, 7% biotite, 6% opaque, 2% plagioclase feldspar, 1% other, 1% 
hornblende, and traces of zircon, plant opal, muscovite, chlorite and 
pyroxene.

Spectral Description:  This sample is spectrally quite similar to 87P3468 
and 87P3665.  The hydroxyl features indicate a mixture of kaolinite and 
montmorillonite.  This sample also shows weak hydrocarbon bands near 
3.42, 3.50, and 2.50 microns.  The relative intensities of the quartz 
combination tone bands on the long wavelength flank of the primary volume 
scattering peak indicate a particle size range intermediate between those of the 
the two similar samples.  The rather weak quartz reststrahlen doublet between 
7.7 and 9.7 microns shows weak kaolinitic grain coating absorption near 8.98 
microns and a strong K-feldspar reststrahlen peak near 9.27 microns.  The 
presence of 7% biotite appears to be reflected in the broad, weak reflectance 
maximum near 6.6 microns and the weak reststrahlen band near9.90 microns, 
which is unusual for such a small amount of biotite.  A weak volume scattering 
peak can be seen between this weak reststrahlen and the alpha quartz doublet 
near 12.6 microns.
