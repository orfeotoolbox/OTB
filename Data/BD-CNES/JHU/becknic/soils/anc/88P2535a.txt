Weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure, very friable and slightly 
sticky, neutral pH (7.0).  0.96% organic carbon, 25.7% clay, 30.7% silt, 
43.6% sand.

Clay mineralogy: large kaolinite peak, small mica and vermiculite peaks, 
and weak goethite and vermiculite-mica peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 67% biotite, 17% muscovite,10% quartz, 3% goethite, 
2% potassic feldspar, 2% opaque, and traces of garnet, plant opal, 
tourmaline, chlorite, rutile, zircon and others.  

Spectral Description:  Kaolinite dominates the hydroxyl absorption bands, 
contributing a strong short wavelength asymmetrical feature having a 
shoulder near 2.17 microns and a minimum near 2.21 microns.  Kaolinite 
also contributes the typical sharp features near 2.70 and 2.76 microns, with a 
shoulder near 2.74 microns between them.  The next most prominent mineral 
spectroscopically in the near-infrared is muscovite, contributing a second 
shoulder to the 2.21 micron band near 2.20 microns, weak features near 
2.35, 2.44 and 2.90 microns, and contributing to the 2.76 micron feature.  
Despite its physical abundance, biotite is a mineral that displays very weak 
spectral features throughout the spectrum.  It contributes only one weak 
independent absorption band at shorter wavelengths near 2.38 microns, although 
it may contribute to the 2.35 and 2.70 microns features.  Very weak hydrocarbon 
absorption bands can be seen near 3.4 and 3.5 microns superimposed on the 
broad water band.  Quartz combination tone bands can account for all of the 
features on the long wavelength side of the primary volume scattering reflectance 
peak, the relative intensities of which indicate a fairly fine particle size for the 
quartz.  Muscovite and biotite appear to account for the broad absorption 
band near 6.1 microns and the double reflectance peak centered near 6.7 
microns, which otherwise resembles the spectral effect of organic matter.  
The quartz reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 microns is strongly 
overshadowed by reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 microns on its long 
wavelength margin because of its relatively low abundance.  A problem arises 
in assigning the prominent 9.28 micron peak without abundant K-feldspar.  We 
assign this peak and the side band near 9.58 to muscovite.  Despite its great 
abundance, the biotite appears to produce only the weak side band at 9.90 
microns.
