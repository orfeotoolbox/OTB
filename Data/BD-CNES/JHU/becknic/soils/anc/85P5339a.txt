Weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium 
granular; slightly hard, sticky, and plastic, friable with moderate acidity.  
2.29% organic carbon, 30.3% clay, 63.4% silt, 6.3% sand.

Clay mineralogy: medium montmorillonite peak, a small mica peak 
and weak vermicultie and kaolinite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy:  38% quartz, 15% plagioclase feldspar, 11% potassic 
feldspar, 10% mica, 8% plant opal, 7% glass, 4% opaque, 3% pyroxene, 2% 
hornblende, 1% other weathered materials, and traces of tourmaline.

Spectral Description:  The long wavelength asymmetry of the hydroxyl 
feature near 2.21 microns and the broad hydroxyl band near 2.76 microns are 
typical of montmorillonite.  A very weak shoulder near 2.71 microns is due 
to kaolinite, which also contributes to the 2.76 micron feature.  The H-C 
stretching vibration bands near 3.4 and 35 microns are barely discernible, 
but the broad hydrocarbon feature near 2.50 microns is quite distinct.  Quartz 
combination tone absorption bands dominate the long wavelength side of the 
primary volume scattering reflectance peak, with the relative intensity of the 
5.36 micron feature indicating the fine particle size of the quartz.  The 
intensity and sharpness of one feature in this region near 4.27 microns does 
not seem in proportion to the others.  Such a feature is seen in the spectrum 
of microcline, which may account for it.  The broad H-O-H absorption band 
near 6.11 microns may be due in part to montmorillonite, but its intensity 
and the way in which it has quenched the longer wavelength quartz 
combination tone bands is consistent with organic matter.  Montmorillonite 
may contribute to the reflectance peak near 6.61 microns but, again, organic 
matter also account for it.  A weak quartz reststrahlen doublet indented by 
the band gap near 8.6 microns is accompanied by a very weak alpha quartz 
doublet.  A broad reststrahlen feature peaked near 9.27 microns is probably 
due to feldspar.  Muscovite probably accounts for the very weak reflectance 
peak near 9.58 microns.  The broad doublet with peaks near 11.25 and 11.68 
microns and a minimum near 11.40 microns cannot be accounted for by the 
minerals present in this soil.  We attribute it to organic matter.
