3.8% organic carbon, 12.9% clay, 84.1% silt, 6.1% sand.

Clay mineralogy: small montmorillonite, mica, kaolinite and vermicluite 
peaks and weak quartz peak.

Coarse mineralogy:  75% quartz, 14% potassic fledspar, 3% mica, 3% 
opaque, 1% tourmaline, 1% plant opal, 1% zircon, 1% amphibole, 1% other 
weathered minerals.

Spectral Description:  Despite the small amount present, kaolinite dominates 
the hydroxyl absorption bands, displaying the typical short wavelength 
asymmetry of the hydroxyl feature near 2.21 microns, strong, sharp bands 
near 2.71 and 2.76 microns, and weak features near 2.34 and 2.36 microns.  
Montmorillonite probably contributes to the weak feature near 2.34 
vermiculite and to the 2.75 micron feature, accounting for its slight 
broadening.  Hydrocarbon bands near 3.42 and 3.50 microns on the flank of 
the broad water band are accompanied by the typical broad absorption band 
near 2.49 microns and strong H-O-H absorption near 6.1 microns.  The long 
wavelength flank of the primary volume scattering reflectance peak is 
dominated by quartz combination tone absorption bands, the relative 
intensities of which indicate that this sample is dominated by fine particle 
size, although the strong H-O-H absorption quenches the 5.93 micron band.  
The reflectance doublet centered near 6.5 microns may be the result of 
quartz combination tone absorption bands superimposed on the reflectance 
peak of organic matter common in this spectral region.  The quartz 
reststrahlen doublet shows the effect of absorption by kaolinite grain 
coatings in the relative reduction in reflectance of the long wavelength side 
of the doublet, which is almost obscured by a reststrahlen peak near 9.25 
microns contributed by the K-feldspar.  K-feldspar also typically contributes 
the weak side bands near 9.64 and 9.90 microns, although muscovite may 
contribute to the 9.64 micron feature as well.  The broad maximum between 
these features and the alpha quartz doublet are due primarily to the 
secondary volume scattering peak and, perhaps to a contribution by organic 
matter, shows a weak absorption near 10.95 microns due to absorption by 
kaolinite coatings.
