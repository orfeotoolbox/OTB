Weak fine granular structure, slightly hard and very friable, a few very 
rounded ironstone nodules, moderately acidic (pH 5.8).  1.44% organic 
carbon; 8.8% clay, 17.9% silt; 73.3% sand.

Clay mineralogy: medium kaolinite peak, small goethite peak, and weak 
hematite and mica peaks.  

Coarse mineralogy: 96% quartz, 4% iron oxides, and traces of tourmaline, 
zircon, kyanite, potassic feldspar, and weathered aggregate.

Spectral Description:  The near-infrared displays a classic kaolinite 
spectrum, with the short wavelength asymmetry of the 2.21 microns band 
and the weak features near 2.31, 2.35 and 2.38 microns.  These bands are 
accompanied by a strong, sharp hydroxyl feature near 2.71 microns, a 
shoulder near 2.74 microns, and another sharp band near 2.76 microns 
unbroadened by montmorillonite.  Weak H-C bands are displayed near 3.42 
and 3.51 microns on the flank of the broad water band, accompanied by a 
weak, broad hydrocarbon band near 2.49 microns in the near-infrared.  
Quartz combination tone bands can be seen on the long wavelength side of 
the primary volume scattering peak and their relative intensities indicate an 
intermediate particle size for the quartz.  However, the reststrahlen doublet is 
very strongly expressed between 7.7 and 9.7 microns because of the large 
amount present.  Absorption by kaolinite grain coatings has reduced the 
relative height of the long wavelength side of the quartz doublet and 
introduced an absorption band near 8.98 microns.  Note that the longest 
wavelength peak of the quartz doublet is near 9.22 microns rather than near 
9.26 or 9.27 microns, as it is when K-feldspar contributes its reststrahlen 
bands, and the long wavelength flank of the quartz doublet is not extended to 
longer wavelength.  There is one small reflectance peak at the base of this 
flank near 9.88 microns that may be due to hematite.
