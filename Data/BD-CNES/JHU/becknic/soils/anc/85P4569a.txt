Spectral Description:  The hydroxyl features in the near-infrared are typical 
of illite/smectite, having a major absorption near 2.21 microns with smaller 
features near 2.25, 2.30 and 2.35 microns.  A very weak kaolinite shoulder 
can be found near 2.71 microns. The relative strength of the 2.25 micron 
feature and the weakness of the hydroxyl feature near 2.76 microns suggests 
that the mixed layer clay is smectite-rich.  On the long wavelength flank of 
the broad water band weak hydrocarbon bands can be seen near 3.40 and 
3.50 microns, accompanied by a broad, weak band near 2.5 microns in the 
near-infrared.  Weak calcite bands near 3.36 and 3.47 microns are mixed in 
with the hydrocarbon features and calcite may contribute a sharp 2.54 
micron margin to the broad 2.5 micron hydrocarbon feature.  The distinctive 
carbonate absorption band near 3.98 microns tops the primary volume 
scattering peak.  On the long wavelength flank of this peak quartz 
combination tone absorption bands dominate the spectrum, sharpened a little 
by calcite absorption near 4.68 and 5.57 microns.  The relative intensities of 
these bands indicate a fairly fine particle size for the quartz grains.  The 
broad minimum near 6.1 microns is typical of strong H-O-H absorption, 
often in organic matter.  Such material probably accounts for the reflectance 
peak near 6.5 microns.  The quartz reststrahlen doublet between 7.7 and 9.7 
microns is not well displayed, considering the amount of quartz present, and 
is overshadowed by a broad and ill defined reststrahlen on its long 
wavelength flank due to feldspar and glass.  The weakness of the quartz 
features relative to the others is probably because the quartz is present 
primarily in the finer fraction.  Organic matter and secondary volume 
scattering both probably contribute to the broad, weak reflectance peak 
between the reststrahlen features just described and the weakly displayed 
alpha quartz doublet.
