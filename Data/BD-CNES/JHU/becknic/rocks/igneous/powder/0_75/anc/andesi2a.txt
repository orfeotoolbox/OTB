Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The modes of phenocrysts gave 30.05% 
plagioclase, 9.8% hypersthene, 3.10% augite, 1.65% magnetite, and 56.30% 
groundmass.  There was no sign of carbonate in thin section, but chemical 
analysis showed CO2 (see below) and the spectrum also shows weak 
carbonate bands.

Microprobe Analysis:  The composition of the augite phenocrysts was W0 
38%, En 38%, Fs 24%, that for hypersthene gave En 64%, Fs 36%.  The 
average composition of plagioclase phenocrysts ranged from An55 to An58 
(labradorite).
