Composition:

Petrographic Description:  The modes for phenocrysts for this sample gave
26.75% plagioclase, 8.5% augite, 1.05% magnetite, 0.95% hypersthene, and
62.75% groundmass.  The groundmass for these samples consists of 
labradorite, augite, hypersthene, magnetite, ilmenite, trydimite as 
isolated grains and aggregates of small wedge-shaped crystals closely associated
with small patches of intergrown granular quartz and chalcedony, anorthoclase, 
and  partly devitrified glass.

Microprobe Analysis:  The composition of the plagioclase phenocrysts was 
found to range from An59 to An62 (labradorite), while the composition in the 
groundmass ranged from An50 to An55.  The augite phenocryst composition 
was Wo 34%, En 43%, Fs 23%, that of the hypersthene phenocrysts was En 67%, Fs 33%.  
Augite in the groundmass was W0 24%, En 45%, Fs 31%.
