Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A porphyritic, fine grained rock with a felty 
texture consisting of olivine phenocrysts and groundmass phases of olivine,
augite, plagioclase, an orthopyroxene, opaques, some pseudo-brookite and
apatite, along with minor interstitial glass.  The glass analysis is given
below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  Probe analysis indicated the
presence of two opaque phases; chromite and ilmenite.  The latter phase
contained 6% MgO by weight, as did the pseudobrookite, which is typical 
for high-MgO bulk composition basalts.  Glass composition was:
