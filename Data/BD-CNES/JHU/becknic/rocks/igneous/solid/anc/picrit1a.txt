Composition:

Petrographic Description:  A porphyritic sample with a slightly trachytic
texture.  The phenocrysts are all olivine.  The groundmass is fine-grained 
and consists of olivine, plagioclase laths, opaques, augite, and brownish
interstitial glass; the analysis for the glass is given below.

Microprobe Analysis:  (by Rosalind Helz).  The olivine analysis gave a
composition of Fo80, while the feldspar was bytownite (An78).  Titanaugite 
was also probed.  Glass composition was:
