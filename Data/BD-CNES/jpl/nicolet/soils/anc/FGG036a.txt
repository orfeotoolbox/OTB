Red-orange sandy loam containing an estimated texture of 34% finer than 20 um 
(15% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of montmorillonite 
and illite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 76% 
quartz, 9% illite/muscovite, 6% kaolinite and 4% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg036 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.31 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 12.85 
um, and the strong presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine 
grained quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened 
and pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.3 um.
