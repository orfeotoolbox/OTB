Red-orange sandy loam containing an estimated texture of 38% finer than 20 um 
(16% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of kaolinite and/or 
montmorillonite and illite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 67% 
quartz, 11% illite/muscovite, 6% kaolinite and 13% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg037 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.63 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.37 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 12.85 
um, and the strong presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine 
grained quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened 
and pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.37 um. Subtle 
shoulder at 9.9 um and the absorption at 9.0 um is suggestive of kaolinite.
