Sandy Loam/alluvium containing a texture consisting of 57% finer than 20 um (24% 
finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : XRD analysis indicates the presence of predominantly 
illite/muscovite with some kaolinite and expansive clays. 

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this alluvium consisted of 
63% quartz, 11% illite/muscovite, 12% kaolinite and 10% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg008 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the minor presence of the 
doublet feature at 12.86 um and the presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive 
of a fine grained quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the 
broadened and pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.4 
um. The absorption feature at 9.0 um, shoulder-peak at 9.85 um and subtle rise 
at 11 um is suggestive of kaolinite.
