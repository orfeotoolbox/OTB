Red-orange sandy soil containing a texture consisting of 45% finer than 20 um 
(17% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of kaolinite and/or 
montmorillonite and illite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 61% 
quartz, 16% illite/muscovite, 6% kaolinite and 12% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg018 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the subdued longer wavelength 
reststrahlen (9.365 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 12.85 
um, and the presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine grained 
quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened and 
pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.365 um. The 
absorption feature at 9.0 um, shoulder-peak at 9.85 um and subtle rise at 11 um 
is suggestive of kaolinite.
