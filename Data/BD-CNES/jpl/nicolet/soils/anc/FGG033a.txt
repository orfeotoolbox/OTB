Red-orange sandy loam containing an estimated texture of 52% finer than 20 um 
(23% finer than 5 um).

Clay mineralogy : PIMA SWIR spectra indicated the presence of kaolinite and/or 
montmorillonite and illite.

Coarse mineralogy : XRF-normative analysis estimated this soil consisted of 58% 
quartz, 15% illite/muscovite, 13% kaolinite and 11% smectite.

Spectral Description: The FTIR spectrum for fgg033 indicates the quartz 
reststrahlen features at 8.2 and 8.625 um. However the subdued reststrahlen 
features (8.2 um, 9.35 um), the absence of the doublet feature at 12.52 and 
12.85 um, and the strong presence of the 6.4 um feature is suggestive of a fine 
grained quartz texture. The presence of clay is also suggested by the broadened 
and pronounced longer wavelength quartz reststrahlen feature at 9.35 um. The 
absorption feature at 9.0 um, shoulder-peak at 9.93 um and subtle rise at 11 um 
is suggestive of kaolinite.
