Monteverdi was developed 4 years ago in order to provide an integrated
application for capacity building activities (teaching, simple image
manipulation, etc.). Its success went far beyond this initial scope since it
opened the OTB world to a wide range of users who needed a ready to use
graphical tool more than a library of components to write their own processing
chain. With this 4 years of lifetime, we have a lot of feedbacks regarding how
useful the tool was, but also regarding what should be improved to move toward
greater usability and operationnality. 
We therefore decided to rework the Monteverdi concept into a brand new software,
enlightened by this experience.
