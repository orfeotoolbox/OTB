Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) is an open-source C++ library for remote sensing images
processing, distributed under the CeCILL-v2 license.  It has been initiated and
funded by CNES (French space agency) in the frame of a program named ORFEO to
prepare, accompany and promote the use and the exploitation of the images
derived from Pl√©iades satellites (PHR). Orfeo ToolBox aims at enabling large
images state-of-the-art processing even on limited resources laptops, and is
shipped with a set of extensible ready-to-use tools for classical remote sensing
tasks, as well as a fully integrated, end-users oriented software called
Monteverdi.
