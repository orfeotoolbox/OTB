README for ConfigFile distribution
Richard J. Wagner  v2.1  24 May 2004

Instructions
------------

The only necessary files for using this configuration file reader are
"ConfigFile.h" and "ConfigFile.cpp".  The class name is ConfigFile.

Usage examples are in "example.cpp".  Linux or Unix users can type "make" to
compile and then type "make run" to run the example program.

The test program in "tester.cpp" will check that the class properly reads
a variety of simple and complex configuration file entries.  To run the test
program type "make test".

When you are done with the examples and the test program, type "make clean"
to get rid of temporary files.

For Windows or Mac users with a compiler such as Metrowerks CodeWarrior or
Microsoft Visual C++, simply add "example.cpp" and "ConfigFile.cpp" to an
empty C++ console application.  Compile and run to see the configuration
file reader in action.  Do likewise with "tester.cpp" to check that the
code works properly with your compiler.

If you encounter any problems, please e-mail a copy of the output and a
description of the test system to me at "wagnerr@umich.edu".  Any other
feedback is welcome too.


Installation
------------

Just copy the files "ConfigFile.h" and "ConfigFile.cpp" to your working
directory or some other place where your compiler can find them.  Add
"ConfigFile.cpp" to your project and put the following line at the top of
your program to access the ConfigFile class:

#include "ConfigFile.h"
