This page holds resources to handling of vertical coordinate systems (datums
and units) in LAS files. Traditionally LAS files have not been rigorous with
regard to recording the vertical datum and vertical units. In actual use I
(Frank Warmerdam) have been unable to find any existing LAS files (January
2010) with vertical datum information set, though some do set vertical units
information.

With the support of !LizardTech, I have been asked to extend libLAS to support
reading and writing vertical coordinate system information in LAS files, and
to the extent practical to establish some reference information on "best
practices" with regard to describing vertical coordinate systems in LAS files.

Vertical CS in GeoTIFF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The planned approach is to store vertical coordinate system in GeoTIFF tags.
The GeoTIFF specification has always had vertical coordinate system support,
tied to the EPSG codes for vertical coordinate systems and datums. However,
traditionally, the vertical coordinate system support in GeoTIFF has also not
been widely used. So it is hoped that formalization of GeoTIFF tags for
vertical datums in LAS format would also apply for GeoTIFF in general and any
other geotiff oriented formats (GeoJP2 for instance). It is anticipated that
the GeoTIFF representation of a LAS file with a vertical datum set might look
something like this:

::

    Geotiff_Information:
       Version: 1
       Key_Revision: 1.0
       Tagged_Information:
          End_Of_Tags.
       Keyed_Information:
          GTModelTypeGeoKey (Short,1): ModelTypeProjected
          GTRasterTypeGeoKey (Short,1): RasterPixelIsPoint
          ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey (Short,1): PCS_WGS84_UTM_zone_15N
          ProjLinearUnitsGeoKey (Short,1): Linear_Meter
          VerticalCSTypeGeoKey (Short,1): Unknown-5701
          VerticalCitationGeoKey (Ascii,7): "Newlyn"
          VerticalDatumGeoKey (Short,1): Unknown-5101
          VerticalUnitsGeoKey (Short,1): Linear_Meter
          End_Of_Keys.
       End_Of_Geotiff.

Note that VerticalCSTypeGeoKey 5701 is "ODN height", a vertical coordinate
system from the EPSG coordinate reference system table. The vertical
coordinate system 5701 is based on vertical datum 5101 (Ordnance Datum Newlyn)
from the EPSG datum table. The 5701 vertical coordinate system also specifies
use of meters as the vertical linear measure.

So there are four GeoTIFF tags related to vertical coordinate system information:
 * VerticalCSTypeGeoKey: an EPSG coordinate system code of type vertical
   (normally 5600-5799).
 * VerticalCitationGeoKey: a description of the vertical coordinate system,
   often the EPSG user name for the VerticalCS.
 * VerticalDatumGeoKey: An EPSG vertical datum code (normally 5000 to 5299). 
 * VerticalUnitsGeoKey: An EPSG units code (normally 9000 to 9199, 9001=meter)

Interesting things to note:
 * There does not appear to be a VerticalUnitSizeGeoKey allowing user defined
   vertical units similarly to the ProjLinearSizeGeoKey, so it is not
   appropriate to use KvUserDefined for VerticalUnitsGeoKey.
 * The libgeotiff epsg_vertcs.inc file seems to imply that the vertical datum
   codes in the range 5000 to 5299 should be considered vertical coordinate
   systems which they are not in the EPSG data model. It is not clear whether
   this is something that changed in the EPSG data model after the initiation
   of the GeoTIFF specification, or if it was an error by the
   GeoTIFF/libgeotiff authors. This mismatch is why Unknown-5101 above is not
   reported as Newlyn directly. Spec issue reported at
   http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/ticket/24
 * The EPSG and OGC models include an EPSG code for a composite coordinate
   system. The composite coordinate system is a collection of a horizontal
   coordinate system (like PCS_WGS84_UTM_zone_15N) and a vertical coordinate
   system (like 5701 - ODN height). An example is
   [http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/7405/html EPSG:7405] - OSGB36 /
   British National Grid + ODN. There is no way to represent this in a GeoTIFF
   tag.

Vertical CS in OGC WKT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted above, EPSG and OGC have a concept of a compound coordinate system.
An example from the CT 1.0 specification (OGC 09-001) looks like this:


::

    COMPD_CS["OSGB36 / British National Grid + ODN",
        PROJCS["OSGB 1936 / British National Grid",
            GEOGCS["OSGB 1936",
                DATUM["OSGB_1936",
                    SPHEROID["Airy 1830",6377563.396,299.3249646,
                        AUTHORITY["EPSG","7001"]],
                    TOWGS84[375,-111,431,0,0,0,0],
                    AUTHORITY["EPSG","6277"]],
                PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
                    AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
                UNIT["DMSH",0.0174532925199433,
                    AUTHORITY["EPSG","9108"]],
                AXIS["Lat",NORTH],
                AXIS["Long",EAST],
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","4277"]],
            PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
            PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",49],
            PARAMETER["central_meridian",-2],
            PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.999601272],
            PARAMETER["false_easting",400000],
            PARAMETER["false_northing",-100000],
            UNIT["metre",1,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],
            AXIS["E",EAST],
            AXIS["N",NORTH],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","27700"]],
        VERT_CS["Newlyn",
            VERT_DATUM["Ordnance Datum Newlyn",2005,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","5101"]],
            UNIT["metre",1,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],
            AXIS["Up",UP],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","5701"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","7405"]]

The VERT_CS portion is analogous to the information we store in GeoTIFF file
about vertical coordinate systems, though we have no mechanism to hold the
overall name or authority code of the COMPD_CS wrapper.

Interesting things to note:
 * The VERT_DATUM keyword includes a name and a datum type code (2005 in this
   case). The set from the specification is specified in on page 58, section
   12.3.8 which is roughly captured in [wiki:OGCVerticalDatumTypes OGC
   Vertical Datum Types].
 * For reference, the same compound coordinate system is handled similarly in
   [http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/7405/html Geotools]
 * GDAL/OGR, used to process libLAS OGC WKT does not currently have meaningful
   support for vertical or compound coordinate systems.

Vertical CS in PROJ.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJ.4 currently has no support for vertical coordinate systems, nor any way
of representing them.

Sample Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A standard sample file has been prepared demonstrating good practice setting a
vertical cs. The geotiff tags look like:

::

    Geotiff_Information:
       Version: 1
       Key_Revision: 1.0
       Tagged_Information:
          End_Of_Tags.
       Keyed_Information:
          GTModelTypeGeoKey (Short,1): ModelTypeProjected
          GTRasterTypeGeoKey (Short,1): RasterPixelIsArea
          ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey (Short,1): PCS_WGS84_UTM_zone_17N
          ProjLinearUnitsGeoKey (Short,1): Linear_Meter
          VerticalCSTypeGeoKey (Short,1): Unknown-5703
          VerticalCitationGeoKey (Ascii,38): "North American Vertical Datum of 1988"
          VerticalDatumGeoKey (Short,1): Unknown-5103
          VerticalUnitsGeoKey (Short,1): Linear_Meter
          End_Of_Keys.
       End_Of_Geotiff.


The test file is available at:

Proposed LASSpatialReference Interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LASSpatialReference class is used to manipulate the spatial references
which are considered to include the vertical coordinate system. It is proposed
to add the following interfaces.

LASSpatialReference::SetVerticalCS
..............................................................................

This is a fairly low level method to set the vertical coordinate system
information on the spatial reference (setting the appropriate geokeys), and
updating the VLR.

.. code-block:: cpp

    /// Sets the vertical coordinate system using geotiff key values.
    /// This operation should normally be done after setting the horizontal
    /// portion of the coordinate system with something like SetWKT(), 
    /// SetProj4(), SetGTIF() or SetFromUserInput()
    /// \param verticalCSType - An EPSG vertical coordinate system code, 
    /// normally in the range 5600 to 5799, or -1 if one is not available.
    /// \param citation - a textual description of the vertical coordinate 
    /// system or an empty string if nothing is available.
    /// \param verticalDatum - the EPSG vertical datum code, often in the 
    /// range 5100 to 5299 - implied by verticalCSType if that is provided, or 
    /// -1 if no value is available.
    /// \param verticalUnits - the EPSG vertical units code, often 9001 for Metre.

    void LASSpatialReference::SetVerticalCS( int verticalCSType, 
                                            std::string const& citation,
                                            int verticalDatum,
                                            int verticalUnits )


It is mainly intended for those wishing to extend coordinate system
information from another source (WKT, PROJ.4, an existing las file) with
vertical cs data in a convenient fashion. This will be used to implement
-a_vertcs in las2las.

LASSpatialReference::GetWKT()
..............................................................................

This method will be modified to support read with or without the compound
coordinate system.


.. code-block:: cpp

    enum WKTModeFlag
    {
        eHorizontalOnly = 1,
        eCompoundOK = 2
    };

    /// Returns the OGC WKT describing Spatial Reference System.
    /// If GDAL is linked, it uses GDAL's operations and methods to determine 
    /// the WKT.  If GDAL is not linked, no WKT is returned.
    /// \param mode_flag May be eHorizontalOnly indicating the WKT will not 
    /// include vertical coordinate system info (the default), or 
    /// eCompoundOK indicating the the returned WKT may be a compound 
    /// coordinate system if there is vertical coordinate system info 
    /// available.
    std::string GetWKT( WKTModeFlag mode_flag = eHorizontalOnly ) const;


Note, that while eHorizontalOnly is the default, this is just to avoid
compatibility problems. eCompoundOK is the general version of the function and
returns a COMPD_CS coordinate system with the vertical coordinate system if
there is vertical information available, otherwise is just returns the normal
horizontal coordinate system.

Internally this is implemented by improvements to GTIFGetOGISDefn() in GDAL. 

LASSpatialReference::SetWKT()
..............................................................................

This existing method will be changed to support setting vertical CS
information if the passed in WKT is a compound coordinate system. The
interface would not change, just the breadth of functionality. The actual
implementation of this functionality is in GTIFSetFromOGISDefn() in GDAL.

Proposed Changes to las2las
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is proposed to add two new options to las2las

 * -a_srs <coordinate system info>: This would override the coordinate system
   information as part of the las2las conversion, but without actually doing
   any geometric transformation - analygous to -a_srs in tools like
   gdal_translate or ogr2ogr.
 * -a_vertcs verticalCSType citation verticalDatum verticalUnits: This option
   would allow overriding/setting the vertical coordinate system information
   during las2las processing. Mostly this would be used to set vertical
   coordinate system information when it was missing. The arguments are the
   epsg code numbers except for citation which is a string (empty to not set a
   citation).

The goal is to make las2las more useful as a "coordinate system fixing up"
tool, including a fairly convenient ability to set the vertical coordinate
system information on files that were missing it.

Changes in GDAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes have been made in GDAL to better support libLAS vertical
coordinate system handling:

 * SetFromUserInput() was modified to recognise COMPD_CS as a valid root so a
   compound coordinate system can be set this way. Mainly useful for las2las.
 * GTIFGetOGISDefn() was extended to build a COMPD_CS coordinate system if
   there is vertical coordinate system info.
 * GTIFSetFromOGISDefn() was extended to write vertical cs tags if there is
   vertical cs information in the WKT.
 * OGRSpatialReference was extended with the StripVertical() method to remove
   COMPD_CS wrappers from a compound coordinate system (used by GetWKT() to
   strip off vertical stuff).

These changes will be in GDAL 1.7.

Changes in libgeotiff
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes have been made in libgeotiff to better support libLAS
vertical coordinate system handling:

 * GTIFValueName() now knows how to translate !VerticalUnitsGeoKey.
 * GTIFNew() now reads existing geotiff file tags in a way that support update
   in place within the GTIF structure.
 * libLASSortKeys() was rewritten to be less fragile in the face of malformed sets
   of geokeys, such as those common in LAS files with several "0" keys at the
   end.

These changes will be in libgeotiff 1.3.0.  They are mostly useful for las2las.
