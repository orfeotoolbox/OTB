We provide binary package for GNU/Linux x86_64. This package include
all of OTB applications along with commandline and graphical launchers.

This package is a self-extractible archive. You may uncompress it with a
double-click on the file, or with the command line :

.. parsed-literal::

   chmod +x OTB-|release|-Linux64.run
   ./OTB-|release|-Linux64.run

Please note that the resulting installation is not meant to be moved,
you should uncompress the archive in its final location. Once the
archive is extracted, the directory structure is made of:

-  ``monteverdi.sh`` : A launcher script for Monteverdi

-  ``mapla.sh`` : A launcher script for Mapla

-  ``otbenv.profile`` : A script to initialize the environment for OTB
   executables

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.sh,
   otbgui.sh), Monteverdi and Mapla.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing all shared libraries and OTB
   applications.

-  ``share`` : A folder containing common resources and copyright
   mentions.

In order to run the command line launchers, this package doesn’t require
any special library that is not present in most modern Linux
distributions. The graphical executable (otbgui launchers, Monteverdi
and Mapla) use the X11 libraries, which are widely used in a lot of
distributions :

::

    libx11-6 libxext6 libxau6 libxxf86vm1 libxdmcp6 libdrm2

Monteverdi also requires the standard graphics libraries libgl1 and
libglu1. Make sure you have at least one version of them installed
in your system.

The applications can be launched from the Mapla launcher. If you want to
use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you can initialize your environment
with ``source otbenv.profile``.

Notes:

- You must use monteverdi and mapla through ``mapla.sh`` and ``monteverdi.sh`` helper scripts in extracted directory.

- The helper scripts for monteverdi and mapla set required environment variables

- You might be tempted to move "OTB-|release|-Linux64" into another location say /usr/local/ after extraction. But avoid this action!

- To have "OTB-|release|-Linux64" installed in /usr/local or /opt execute "OTB-|release|-Linux64.run" in that directory.

- Multiple installation of OTB can exists in same system without one conflicting the other!

FAQ for Packaging
-----------------

Q: I am getting an error message...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40806) with this library (version 0x40807)
   Aborted

A: This is due to a conflict with system Qt4 (usually seen on KDE) and Qt4 + gtk libs in OTB package. The fix you need is to remove those libs from package.

.. parsed-literal::

   cd /path/to/OTB-|release|-Linux64
   rm -f lib/libQt* && rm -fr lib/gtk

Q: Monteverdi and Mapla applications look different from my other applications.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: By default, Monteverdi, Mapla and otbapplication (otbgui\_\*) uses a default gtk theme (plastic)
which is distributed with the OTB package!.  We do this to be on safe side, like when a user does
not have gtk libraries installed when using our package.

gtk libraries in the package is  the reason why you are getting a default "plastic" look & feel that
makes it look different from other GUI applications.
To get same look and feel, you can "force"  Monteverdi and Mapla to use system GTK.

::

   export OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=1

And now start ``monteverdi.sh`` or ``mapla.sh`` from OTB-|release|-Linux64
To get back default behaviour, unset OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=1 or set OTB_USE_SYSTEM_GTK=0
