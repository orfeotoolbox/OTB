A brief tour of OTB Applications
================================

OTB ships with more than 100 ready to use applications for remote sensing tasks.
They usually expose existing processing functions from the underlying C++
library, or integrate them into high level pipelines. OTB applications allow the user 
to:

-  Combine two or more functions from the Orfeo ToolBox,

-  Provide a high level interface to handle: input and output data, 
   definition of parameters and communication with the user.

OTB applications can be launched in different ways, and accessed from different
entry points. While the framework can be extended, the Orfeo ToolBox ships with the following:

-  A command-line launcher, to call applications from the terminal,

-  A graphical launcher, with an auto-generated QT interface, providing
   ergonomic parameters setting, display of documentation, and progress
   reporting,

-  A SWIG interface, which means that any application can be loaded,
   set-up and executed into a high-level language such as Python or Java
   for instance.

-  `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`_  plugin built on top of
   the SWIG/Python interface is available with seamless integration within
   QGIS.

The complete list of applications is described in the Chapter :ref:`apprefdoc`.

All standard applications share the same implementation and automatically expose
generated interfaces.
However they are accessed in a slightly different way: the command-line interface is prefixed by ``otbcli_``, while the Qt interface is prefixed by
``otbgui_``. For instance, calling ``otbcli_DynamicConvert`` will launch the
command-line interface of the DynamicConvert application, while
``otbgui_DynamicConvert`` will launch the GUI.

Command-line launcher
---------------------

The command-line application launcher loads an application
plugin, allows for its parameters to be set, and can then be executed from the command line.
Launching the ``otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine`` without any arguments provided,
results in the following help to be displayed:

::

    $ otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine
    Usage: ./otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine module_name [MODULEPATH] [arguments]

The ``module_name`` parameter corresponds to the application name. The
``[MODULEPATH]`` argument is optional and allows the path to the shared library 
(or plugin) corresponding to the ``module_name`` to be passed to the launcher.

It is also possible to set this path with the environment variable
``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``, making the ``[MODULEPATH]`` optional. This
variable is checked by default when no ``[MODULEPATH]`` argument is
given. When using multiple paths in ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``, one must
ensure that the standard path separator of the target system is used, which
is ``:`` on Unix and ``;`` on Windows.

An error in the application name (i.e. in parameter ``module_name``)
will make the ``otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine`` list the name of
all applications found in the available path (either ``[MODULEPATH]``
and/or ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``).

To ease the use of the applications, and to avoid extensive
environment customizations; ready-to-use scripts are provided by the OTB
installation to launch each application. They take care of adding the
standard application installation path to the ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``
environment variable.

These scripts are named ``otbcli_<ApplicationName>`` and do not need any
path settings. For example, you can start the Orthorectification
application with the script called ``otbcli_Orthorectification``.

Launching an application without parameters, or with incomplete parameters, will cause the
launcher to display a summary of the parameters. This summary will display the minimum set
of parameters that are required to execute the application. Here is an
example based on the OrthoRectification application:

::

    $ otbcli_OrthoRectification
    ERROR: Waiting for at least one parameter.


    This is the Ortho-rectification (OrthoRectification) application, version 6.7.0

    This application allows ortho-rectifying optical and radar images from supported sensors.

For a detailed description of the application behaviour and parameters,
please check the application reference documentation presented
in chapter :ref:`apprefdoc`  or follow the ``DOCUMENTATION``
hyperlink provided in the output of ``otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine``.
Parameters are passed to the application using the parameter key (which
might include one or several ``.`` character), prefixed by a ``-``.
Command-line examples are provided in the chapter :ref:`apprefdoc`.

Graphical launcher
------------------

The graphical interface for the applications provides a useful
interactive user interface to set the parameters, choose files, and
monitor the execution progress.

This launcher needs the same two arguments as the command line launcher:

::

    $ otbApplicationLauncherQt module_name [MODULEPATH]

The application paths can be set with the ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``
environment variable, as for the command line launcher. Also, as for the
command-line application, a more simple script is generated and
installed by OTB to ease the configuration of the module path: to
launch the graphical user interface, one will start the
``otbgui_Rescale`` script.

The resulting graphical application displays a window with several tabs:

-  Parameters is where you set the parameters and execute the
   application.

-  Logs is where you see the output given by the application during its
   execution.

-  Progress is where you see a progress bar of the execution (not
   available for all applications).

-  Documentation is where you find a summary of the application
   documentation.

In this interface, every optional parameter has a check box that you
have to tick if you want to set a value and use this parameter. The
mandatory parameters cannot be unchecked.

The interface of the application is shown here as an example:

.. figure:: Art/QtImages/rescale_param.png
    :align: center

Python interface
----------------

The applications can also be accessed from Python, through a module
named ``otbApplication``. However, there are technical requirements to use it.
If you use OTB through standalone packages, you should use the supplied
environment script ``otbenv`` to properly setup variables such as
``PYTHONPATH`` and ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH`` (on Unix systems, don't forget to
source the script). In other cases, you should set these variables depending on
your configuration.

On Unix systems, it is typically available in the ``/usr/lib/otb/python``
directory. Depending on how you installed OTB, you may need to configure the
environment variable ``PYTHONPATH`` to include this directory so that the module
becomes available from Python.

On Windows, you can install the ``otb-python`` package, and the module
will be automatically available from an OSGeo4W shell.

As for the command line and GUI launchers, the path to the application
modules needs to be properly set with the ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``
environment variable. The standard location on Unix systems is
``/usr/lib/otb/applications``. On Windows, the applications are
available in the ``otb-bin`` OSGeo4W package, and the environment is
configured automatically so ``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH`` doesn't need to be modified
``OTB_APPLICATION_PATH``.

Once your environment is set, you can use OTB applications from Python, just
like this small example:

.. code-block:: python

    #  Example on the use of the Smoothing application

    # The python module providing access to OTB applications is otbApplication
    import otbApplication as otb

    # Let's create the application with codename "Smoothing"
    app = otb.Registry.CreateApplication("Smoothing")

    # We set its parameters
    app.SetParameterString("in", "my_input_image.tif")
    app.SetParameterString("type", "mean")
    app.SetParameterString("out", "my_output_image.tif")

    # This will execute the application and save the output file
    app.ExecuteAndWriteOutput()

For more information about this Python interface, check the recipe section.

Load and save parameters to XML
-------------------------------

Since OTB 3.20, OTB applications parameters can be export/import to/from
an XML file using inxml/outxml parameters. Those parameters are
available in all applications.

An example is worth a thousand words

::

    otbcli_BandMath -il input_image_1 input_image_2
                    -exp "abs(im1b1 - im2b1)"
                    -out output_image
                    -outxml saved_applications_parameters.xml

Then, you can run the applications with the same parameters using the
output XML file previously saved. For this, you have to use the inxml
parameter:

::

    otbcli_BandMath -inxml saved_applications_parameters.xml

Note that you can also add additional parameters to the command line at the same
time

::

    otbcli_BandMath -inxml saved_applications_parameters.xml
                    -exp "(im1b1 - im2b1)"

In this case it will use as mathematical expression “(im1b1 - im2b1)”
instead of “abs(im1b1 - im2b1)”.

Finally, you can also launch applications directly from the command-line
launcher executable using the inxml parameter without having to declare
the application name. Use in this case:

::

    otbApplicationLauncherCommandLine -inxml saved_applications_parameters.xml

It will retrieve the application name and related parameters from the
input XML file and launch in this case the BandMath applications.

Parallel execution with MPI
---------------------------

Provided that Orfeo ToolBox has been built with MPI and SPTW modules
activated, it is possible to use MPI for massive parallel computation
and writing of an output image. A simple call to ``mpirun`` before the
command-line activates this behaviour, with the following logic. MPI
writing is only triggered if:

- OTB is built with MPI and SPTW,

- The number of MPI processes is greater than 1,

- The output filename is ``.tif`` or ``.vrt``


In this case, the output image will be divided into several tiles
according to the number of MPI processes specified to the ``mpirun``
command, and all tiles will be computed in parallel.

If the output filename extension is ``.tif``, tiles will be written in
parallel to a single Tiff file using SPTW (Simple Parallel Tiff Writer).

If the output filename extension is ``.vrt``, each tile will be
written to a separate Tiff file, and a global VRT_ file will be written.

.. _VRT: http://gdal.org/gdal_vrttut.html

Here is an example of MPI call on a cluster::

  $ mpirun -np $nb_procs --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE  \
    otbcli_BundleToPerfectSensor \
    -inp $ROOT/IMG_PHR1A_P_001/IMG_PHR1A_P_201605260427149_ORT_1792732101-001_R1C1.JP2 \
    -inxs $ROOT/IMG_PHR1A_MS_002/IMG_PHR1A_MS_201605260427149_ORT_1792732101-002_R1C1.JP2 \
    -out $ROOT/pxs.tif uint16 -ram 1024

One can see that the registration and pan-sharpening of the
panchromatic and multi-spectral bands of a Pleiades image has been split
between 560 CPUs and only took 56 seconds to complete.

Note that this MPI parallel invocation of applications is only
available for command-line calls to OTB applications, and only for
images output parameters.
