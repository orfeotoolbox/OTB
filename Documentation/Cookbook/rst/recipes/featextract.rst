Feature extraction
==================

The term *Feature Extraction*
refers to techniques aiming at extracting added value information from
images. These extracted items named *features* can be local statistical
moments, edges, radiometric indices, morphological and textural
properties. For example, such features can be used as input data for
other image processing methods like *Segmentation* and
`Classification <https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/recipes/pbclassif.html#feature-classification>`_ .

Local statistics extraction
---------------------------

This application computes the 4 local statistical moments on every pixel
in the selected channel of the input image, over a specified
neighborhood. The output image is multi band with one statistical moment
(feature) per band. Thus, the 4 output features are the Mean, the
Variance, the Skewness and the Kurtosis. They are provided in this exact
order in the output image.

The *LocalStatisticExtraction* application has the following input
parameters:

-``-in`` the input image to compute the features on

-``-channel`` the selected channel index in the input image to be
   processed (default value is 1)

-``-radius`` the computational window radius (default value is 3
   pixels)

-``-out`` the output image containing the local statistical moments

The application can be used like this:

::

    otbcli_LocalStatisticExtraction  -in        InputImage.tif
                                     -channel   1
                                     -radius    3
                                     -out       OutputImage.tif

Edge extraction
---------------

This application Computes edge features on every pixel in the selected
channel of the input image.

The *EdgeExtraction* application has the following input parameters:

-``-in`` the input image to compute the features on

-``-channel`` the selected channel index in the input image to be
   processed (default value is 1)

- ``-filter`` the choice of edge detection method (gradient/sobel/touzi) (default value is gradient)   

 -``(-filter.touzi.xradius)`` the X Radius of the Touzi processing neighborhood (only if filter==touzi) (default value is 1 pixel) __

 - ``(-filter.touzi.yradius)`` the Y Radius of the Touzi processing neighborhood (only if filter==touzi) (default value is 1 pixel)   

-``-out`` the output mono band image containing the edge features

The application can be used like this:

::

    otbcli_EdgeExtraction  -in        InputImage
                           -channel   1
                           -filter    sobel
                           -out       OutputImage

or like this if filter==touzi:

::

    otbcli_EdgeExtraction  -in                    InputImage
                           -channel               1
                           -filter                touzi
                           -filter.touzi.xradius  2
                           -filter.touzi.yradius  2 
                           -out                   OutputImage

Radiometric indices extraction
------------------------------

This application computes radiometric indices using the channels of the
input image. The output is a multi band image into which each channel is
one of the selected indices.

                              -list           Water:NDWI2

Textural features extraction
----------------------------

Texture features can be extracted with the help of image filters based
on texture analysis methods like Haralick and structural feature set
(SFS).

Haralick texture features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application computes Haralick, advanced and higher order texture
features on every pixel in the selected channel of the input image. The
output image is multi band with a feature per band.

The *HaralickTextureExtraction* application has the following input

-``-in`` the input image to compute the features on

-``-channel`` the selected channel index in the input image to be
   processed (default value is 1)

-``-texture`` the texture set selection [simple/advanced/higher]
   (default value is simple)

-``-parameters.min`` the input image minimum (default value is 0)

-``-parameters.max`` the input image maximum (default value is 255)

-``-parameters.xrad`` the X Radius of the processing neighborhood
   (default value is 2 pixels)

-``-parameters.yrad`` the Y Radius of the processing neighborhood
   (default value is 2 pixels)

   co-occurrence computation (default value is 1 pixel)

   co-occurrence computation (default value is 1 pixel)

-``-parameters.nbbin`` the number of bin per axis for histogram
   generation (default value is 8)

   features (one feature per band)

The available values for -texture with their relevant features are:

-``-texture=simple:`` In this case, 8 local Haralick textures features
   will be processed. The 8 output image channels are: Energy, Entropy,
   Correlation, Inverse Difference Moment, Inertia, Cluster Shade,
   Cluster Prominence and Haralick Correlation. They are provided in
   this exact order in the output image. Thus, this application computes
   the following Haralick textures over a neighborhood with user defined
   radius. To improve the speed of computation, a variant of Grey Level
   Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) called Grey Level Co-occurrence Indexed
   List (GLCIL) is used. Given below is the mathematical explanation on
   the computation of each textures. Here :math:`g(i, j)` is the
   frequency of element in the GLCIL whose index is i, j. GLCIL stores a
   pair of frequency of two pixels taken from the given offset and the
   cell index (i, j) of the pixel in the neighborhood window. :(where
   each element in GLCIL is a pair of pixel index and it’s frequency,
   :math:`g(i, j)` is the frequency value of the pair having index is
   i, j).

   “Energy” :math:`= f_1 = \sum_{i, j}g(i, j)^2`

   “Entropy” :math:`= f_2 = -\sum_{i, j}g(i, j) \log_2 g(i, j)`, or 0
   if :math:`g(i, j) = 0`

   “Inertia” :math:`= f_5 = \sum_{i, j}(i - j)^2g(i, j)` (sometimes
   called “contrast”)

   “Cluster Shade”
   :math:`= f_6 = \sum_{i, j}((i - \mu) + (j - \mu))^3 g(i, j)`

   “Cluster Prominence”
   :math:`= f_7 = \sum_{i, j}((i - \mu) + (j - \mu))^4 g(i, j)`

   “Haralick’s Correlation”
   :math:`= f_8 = \frac{\sum_{i, j}(i, j) g(i, j) -\mu_t^2}{\sigma_t^2}`
   where :math:`\mu_t` and :math:`\sigma_t` are the mean and standard
   deviation of the row (or column, due to symmetry) sums. Above,
   :math:`\mu =` (weighted pixel average)
   :math:`= \sum_{i, j}i \cdot g(i, j) = \sum_{i, j}j \cdot g(i, j)`
   (due to matrix symmetry), and :math:`\sigma =` (weighted pixel
   variance)
   :math:`= \sum_{i, j}(i - \mu)^2 \cdot g(i, j) = \sum_{i, j}(j - \mu)^2 \cdot g(i, j)`
   (due to matrix symmetry).

-``-texture=advanced:`` In this case, 10 advanced texture features
   will be processed. The 10 output image channels are: Mean, Variance,
   Dissimilarity, Sum Average, Sum Variance, Sum Entropy, Difference of
   Entropies, Difference of Variances, IC1 and IC2. They are provided in
   this exact order in the output image. The textures are computed over
   a sliding window with user defined radius.

   To improve the speed of computation, a variant of Grey Level
   Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) called Grey Level Co-occurrence Indexed
   List (GLCIL) is used. Given below is the mathematical explanation on
   the computation of each textures. Here :math:`g(i, j)` is the
   frequency of element in the GLCIL whose index is i, j. GLCIL stores a

   each element in GLCIL is a pair of pixel index and it’s frequency,
   :math:`g(i, j)` is the frequency value of the pair having index is

   :math:`= f_12 = \frac{f_9 - HXY1}{H}`

   “Information Measures of Correlation IC2”
   :math:`= f_13 = \sqrt{1 - \exp{-2}|HXY2 - f_9|}`

   Above, :math:`\mu =` (weighted pixel average)
   :math:`= \sum_{i, j}i \cdot g(i, j) =  \sum_{i, j}j \cdot g(i, j)`
   (due to matrix summetry), and

   :math:`g_{x+y}(k) =  \sum_{i}\sum_{j}g(i)` where :math:`i+j=k`
   and :math:`k = 2, 3, .., 2N_{g}` and

   :math:`g_{x-y}(k) =  \sum_{i}\sum_{j}g(i)` where :math:`i-j=k`
   and :math:`k = 0, 1, .., N_{g}-1`

-``-texture=higher:`` In this case, 11 local higher order statistics
   texture coefficients based on the grey level run-length matrix will
   be processed. The 11 output image channels are: Short Run Emphasis,

   Grey-Level Run Emphasis, Short Run Low Grey-Level Emphasis, Short Run
   High Grey-Level Emphasis, Long Run Low Grey-Level Emphasis and Long
   Run High Grey-Level Emphasis. They are provided in this exact order
   in the output image. Thus, this application computes the following
   Haralick textures over a sliding window with user defined radius:
   (where :math:`p(i, j)` is the element in cell i, j of a normalized
   Run Length Matrix, :math:`n_r` is the total number of runs and

SFS texture extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application computes Structural Feature Set textures on every pixel
in the selected channel of the input image. The output image is multi
band with a feature per band. The 6 output texture features are
SFS’Length, SFS’Width, SFS’PSI, SFS’W-Mean, SFS’Ratio and SFS’SD. They
are provided in this exact order in the output image.

It is based on line direction estimation and described in the following
publication. Please refer to Xin Huang, Liangpei Zhang and Pingxiang Li
publication, Classification and Extraction of Spatial Features in Urban
Areas Using High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery. IEEE Geoscience and
Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 4, n. 2, 2007, pp 260-264.

The texture is computed for each pixel using its neighborhood. User can
set the spatial threshold that is the max line length, the spectral
threshold that is the max difference authorized between a pixel of the
line and the center pixel of the current neighborhood. The adjustement
constant alpha and the ratio Maximum Consideration Number, which
describes the shape contour around the central pixel, are used to
compute the :math:`w - mean` value.

The *SFSTextureExtraction* application has the following input
parameters:

-``-in`` the input image to compute the features on

-``-channel`` the selected channel index in the input image to be
   processed (default value is 1)

-``-parameters.spethre`` the spectral threshold (default value is 50)

-``-parameters.spathre`` the spatial threshold (default value is 100
   pixels)

-``-parameters.nbdir`` the number of directions (default value is 20)

-``-parameters.alpha`` the alpha value (default value is 1)

-``-parameters.maxcons`` the ratio Maximum Consideration Number
   (default value is 5)

-``-out`` the output multi band image containing the selected texture
   features (one feature per band)
