We provide for MacOS X through a standalone package. This package is a
self-extractible archive, quite similar to the Linux one. You may
uncompress it with the command line :

.. parsed-literal::

    chmod +x OTB-|release|-Linux64.run
    ./OTB-|release|-Linux64.run

Once the archive is extracted, you can see OTB-|release|-Darwin64 directory in
the same direcrtory along with OTB-|release|-Darwin64.run

Contents of OTB-|release|-Darwin64 is briefly listed below:

-  ``Monteverdi.app`` : A Mac OSX .app for Monteverdi

-  ``Mapla.app`` : A Mac OSX .app for Mapla.

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.sh,
   otbgui.sh), monteverdi and mapla binaries.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing all shared libraries and OTB
   applications.

-  ``share`` : A folder containing common resources and copyright
   mentions.

Notes:

-  If you want to use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you must access
   them via a terminal prompt.

-  The OSX .app are provided for monteverdi (viewer) and mapla
   (application browser).

-  You must use monteverdi and mapla through their .app files only.

-  You are allowed to move these .app files and refrain from moving or
   deleting OTB-|release|-Darwin64 after extraction. In case you need to have OTB
   installed in some other directory. Extract the .run file there.
