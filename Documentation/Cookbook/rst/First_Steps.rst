First Steps
===========

You can install and use OTB via 3 different methods :

    - the standalone packages
    - the docker image
    - building from source

In this page, we describe simple use cases to make your first steps in the OTB world. This chapter covers OTB Core installation (including its required dependencies) and launch of applications.
For a more detailed installation process, you can refer to the :doc:`Installation` page after installing the required dependencies

MacOS support will be deprecated in OTB > 8 because the Toolbox cannot be compiled natively on ARM (Apple Silicon) architecture.
We recommend using the docker image which works perfectly on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures
