\end{figure}

This chapter introduces the functionnalities available in OTB for
image ortho-registration. We define ortho-registration as the
procedure allowing to transform an image in sensor geometry to a
geographic or cartographic projection.\\

Figure \ref{fig:ImageOrtho-registrationProcedure} shows a synoptic
view of the different steps involved in a classical ortho-registration
processing chain able to deal with image series. These steps are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sensor modelling: the geometric sensor model allows to convert
  image coordinates (line, column) into geographic coordinates
  (latitude, longitude); a rigorous modelling needs a digital
  elevation model (DEM) in order to take into account the terrain
  topography.
  \item Bundle-block adjustment: in the case of image series, the
  geometric models and their parameters can be refined by using
  homologous points between the images. This is an optional step and
  not currently implemented in OTB.
  \item Map projection: this step allows to go from geographic
  coordinates to some specific cartographic projection as Lambert,
  Mercator or UTM.
\end{itemize}


\section{Sensor Models}
\ifitkFullVersion
\label{sec:SensorModels}
\fi

A sensor model is a set of equations giving the relationship between
image pixel $(l,c)$ coordinates and ground $(X,Y)$ coordinates for every
pixel in the image. Typically, the ground coordinates are given in a
geographic projection (latitude, longitude). The sensor model
can be expressed either from image to ground -- forward model -- or
from ground to image -- inverse model. This can be written as follows:

\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{cc}
    Forward & \\
    X = f_x(l,c,h,\vec\theta) & Y = f_y(l,c,h,\vec\theta)\\
     & \\
    Inverse & \\
    l = g_l(X,Y,h,\vec\theta) & c = g_c(X,Y,h,\vec\theta)
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

Where $\vec\theta$ is the set of parameters which describe the sensor
and the acquisition geometry (platform altitude, viewing angle, focal
length for optical sensors, doppler centroid for SAR images, etc.).\\

In OTB, sensor models are implemented as \doxygen{itk}{Transform}s
(see section \ref{sec:Transforms} for details), which is the
appropriate way to express coordinate changes. The base class for
sensor models is \doxygen{otb}{SensorModelBase} from which the classes
\doxygen{otb}{InverseSensorModel} and
\doxygen{otb}{ForwardSensorModel} inherit.\\

As one may note from the model equations, the height of the ground, $h$,
must be known. Usually, it means that a Digital Elevation Model,
DEM, will be used.\\


\subsection{Types of Sensor Models}
\label{sec:TypesofSensorModels}
There exists two main types of sensor models. On one hand, we have the
so-called {\em physical models}, which are rigorous, complex,
eventually highly non-linear equations of the sensor geometry. As
such, they are difficult to inverse (obtain the inverse model from the
forward one and vice-versa). They have the significant advantage of having
parameters with physical meaning (angles, distances, etc.). They are
specific of each sensor, which means that a library of models is
required in the software. A library which has to be updated every time a new
sensor is available.\\

On the other hand, we have general analytical models, which
approximate the physical models. These models can take the form of
polynomials or ratios of polynomials, the so-called rational
polynomial functions or Rational Polynomial Coefficients, RPC, also
known as {\em Rapid Positioning Capability}.
Since they are approximations, they are less accurate than the
physical models. However, the achieved accuracy is usually high: in
the case of Pl\'eiades, RPC models have errors lower than 0.02 pixels
with respect to the physical model. Since these models have a standard
form they are easier to use and implement. However, they have the
drawback of having parameters (coefficients, actually) without
physical meaning.\\

OTB, through the use of the OSSIM library --
\url{http://www.ossim.org} -- offers models for most of current
sensors either through a physical or an analytical approach. This is
transparent for the user, since the geometrical model for a given
image is instantiated using the information stored in its meta-data. The 
search for a sensor model is not straightforward. It is done in several steps :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Load an external \code{.geom} file specified through extended filenames
(if present)
  \item Load the \code{.geom} file attached with the input image (if present).
They share the same name, without extension.
  \item Search in the OSSIM plugin factory for a suitable model 
(\code{ossimplugins::ossimPluginProjectionFactory}). For instance, this
factory contains Pl\'eiades and TerraSar sensor models.
  \item If no model was found, search in the OSSIM projection factory 
(\code{ossimProjectionFactoryRegistry}). For instance this factory contains
Spot5, Landsat and Quickbird sensor models.
  \item If no model was found, search any RPC tags in the input image. When the
tags are present, an \code{ossimRpcModel} is created.
  \item If still no model was found, search for a valid sensor model in other
files attached to the current dataset. For instance, with a Sentinel-1 SAFE XML
product, it will inspect underlying \code{.tiff} files. With a VRT dataset, it
will inspect the files referenced by the VRT.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the \code{.geom} metadata file can store any sensor model recognized
by OSSIM.

\subsection{Using Sensor Models}
\label{sec:UsingSensorModels}

The transformation of an image in sensor geometry to geographic
geometry can be done using the following steps.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Read image meta-data and instantiate the model with the
    given parameters.
  \item Define the ROI in ground coordinates (this is your output
  pixel array)
  \item Iterate through the pixels of coordinates $(X,Y)$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Get $h$ from the DEM
      \item Compute $(c,l) = G(X,Y,h,\vec\theta)$
      \item Interpolate pixel values if $(c,l)$ are not grid coordinates.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

Actually, in OTB, you don't have to manually instantiate the sensor
model which is appropriate to your image. That is, you don't have to
manually choose a SPOT5 or a Quickbird sensor model. This task is
automatically performed by the \doxygen{otb}{ImageFileReader} class in
a similar way as the image format recognition is done. The appropriate
sensor model will then be included in the image meta-data, so you can
access it when needed.

\subsection{Evaluating Sensor Model}
\label{sec:EvaluatingSensorModels}

If no appropriate sensor model is available in the image meta-data,
OTB offers the possibility to estimate a sensor model from the image.

\input{EstimateRPCSensorModelExample.tex}


\subsection{Limits of the Approach}
\label{LimitsoftheApproach}

As you may understand by now, accurate geo-referencing needs accurate
DEM and also accurate sensor models and parameters. In the case where
we have several images acquired over the same area by different
sensors or different geometric configurations, geo-referencing (geographical coordinates) or ortho-rectification
(cartographic coordinates) is not usually enough. Indeed, when working
with image series we usually want to compare them (fusion, change
detection, etc.) at the pixel level.\\

Since common DEM and sensor parameters do not allow for such an
accuracy, we have to use clever strategies to improve the
co-registration of the images. The classical one consists in refining
the sensor parameters by taking homologous points between the images
to co-register. This is called bundle block adjustment and will be
implemented in coming versions of OTB.

Even if the model parameters are refined, errors due to DEM accuracy
can not be eliminated. In this case, image to image registration can
be applied. These approaches are presented in chapters
\ref{chap:ImageRegistration} and \ref{sec:DisparityMapEstimation}.

\section{Map Projections}
\ifitkFullVersion
\label{sec:MapProjections}
\fi

Map projections describe the link between geographic coordinates and
cartographic ones. So map projections allow to represent a 2-dimensional manifold of a
3-dimensional space (the Earth surface) in a 2-dimensional space (a
map which used to be a sheet of paper!). This geometrical
transformation doesn't have a unique solution, so over the cartography
history, every country or region in the world has been able to express
the belief of being the center of the universe. In other words, every
cartographic projection tries to minimize the distortions of the 3D to
2D transformation for a given point of the Earth surface\footnote{We
  proposed to optimize an OTB map projection for Toulouse, but we
  didn't get any help from OTB users.}.

In OTB the \doxygen{otb}{MapProjection} class is derived from the
\doxygen{itk}{Transform} class, so the coordinate transformation
points are overloaded with map projection equations. The
\doxygen{otb}{MapProjection} class is templated over the type of
cartographic projection, which is provided by the OSSIM library. In
order to hide the complexity of the approach, some type definitions
for the more common projections are given in the file
\code{otbMapProjections.h} file.

Sometimes, you don't know at compile time what map projection you will need in
your application. In this case, the \doxygen{otb}{GenericMapProjection}
allow you to set the map projection at run-time by passing the WKT identification
for the projection.

\input{MapProjectionExample.tex}

You will seldom use a map projection by itself, but rather in an
ortho-rectification framework. An example is given in the next section.
