\chapter{How To Write A Filter}
\label{chapter:WriteAFilter}

This purpose of this chapter is help developers create their own
filter (process object).  This chapter is divided into four major
parts. An initial definition of terms is followed by an overview of
the filter creation process. Next, data streaming is discussed. The
way data is streamed in ITK must be understood in order to write
correct filters. Finally, a section on multithreading describes what
you must do in order to take advantage of shared memory parallel
processing.

\section{Terminology}
\label{sec:Terminology}

The following is some basic terminology for the discussion that follows.
Chapter \ref{chapter:SystemOverview} provides additional background
information.

\begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{data processing pipeline} is a directed graph of
        \textbf{process} and \textbf{data objects}. The pipeline inputs,
        operators on, and outputs data.
        \index{data processing pipeline}
        \index{process object}
        \index{data object}

        \item A \textbf{filter}, or \textbf{process object}, has one or more
        inputs, and one or more outputs.
        \index{filter}

        \item A \textbf{source}, or source process object, initiates the data
        processing pipeline, and has one or more outputs.
        \index{source}

        \item A \textbf{mapper}, or mapper process object, terminates the
        data processing pipeline. The mapper has one or more outputs, and may
        write data to disk, interface with a display system, or interface to
        any other system.
        \index{mapper}

        \item A \textbf{data object} represents and provides access to
        data. In ITK, the data object (ITK class \doxygen{itk}{DataObject}) is 
        typically of type \doxygen{otb}{Image} or \doxygen{itk}{Mesh}.
        \index{data object}

        \item A \textbf{region} (ITK class \doxygen{itk}{Region}) represents a 
        piece, or subset of the entire data set.
        \index{region}

        \item An \textbf{image region} (ITK class \doxygen{itk}{ImageRegion})
        represents a structured portion of data. ImageRegion is implemented
        using the \doxygen{itk}{Index} and \doxygen{itk}{Size} classes
        \index{image region}

        \item A \textbf{mesh region} (ITK class \doxygen{itk}{MeshRegion}) 
        represents an unstructured portion of data.
        \index{mesh region}

        \item The \textbf{LargestPossibleRegion} is the theoretical single,
        largest piece (region) that could represent the entire dataset. The
        LargestPossibleRegion is used in the system as the measure of the
        largest possible data size.
        \index{LargestPossibleRegion}

        \item The \textbf{BufferedRegion} is a contiguous block of memory
        that is less than or equal to in size to the
        LargestPossibleRegion. The buffered region is what has actually been
        allocated by a filter to hold its output.
        \index{BufferedRegion}

        \item The \textbf{RequestedRegion} is the piece of the dataset that a
        filter is required to produce. The RequestedRegion is less than or
        equal in size to the BufferedRegion. The RequestedRegion may differ
        in size from the BufferedRegion due to performance reasons. The
        RequestedRegion may be set by a user, or by an application that needs
        just a portion of the data.
        \index{RequestedRegion}

        \item The \textbf{modified time} (represented by ITK class
        \doxygen{itk}{TimeStamp}) is a monotonically increasing integer value that
        characterizes a point in time when an object was last modified.
        \index{modified time}

        \item \textbf{Downstream} is the direction of dataflow, from sources
        to mappers.
        \index{pipeline!downstream}

        \item \textbf{Upstream} is the opposite of downstream, from mappers
        to sources.
        \index{pipeline!upstream}

        \item The \textbf{pipeline modified time} for a particular data
        object is the maximum modified time of all upstream data objects and
        process objects.
        \index{pipeline!modified time}

        \item The term \textbf{information} refers to metadata that
        characterizes data. For example, index and dimensions are information
        characterizing an image region.
        \index{pipeline!information}
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of Filter Creation}
\label{sec:OverviewFilterCreation}
\index{filter!overview of creation}

Filters are defined with respect to the type of data they input (if
any), and the type of data they output (if any). The key to writing a
ITK filter is to identify the number and types of input and
output. Having done so, there are often superclasses that simplify
this task via class derivation. For example, most filters in ITK take
a single image as input, and produce a single image on output. The
superclass \doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageFilter} is a convenience class that
provide most of the functionality needed for such a filter.

Some common base classes for new filters include:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \code{ImageToImageFilter}: the most common filter base for
    segmentation algorithms.  Takes an image and produces a new image, by
    default of the same dimensions.  Override
    \code{GenerateOutputInformation} to produce a different size.

  \item \code{UnaryFunctorImageFilter}: used when defining a filter that
  applies a function to an image.

  \item \code{BinaryFunctorImageFilter}: used when defining a filter that
  applies an operation to two images.

  \item \code{ImageFunction}: a functor that can be applied to an image,
  evaluating $f(x) $ at each point in the image.

  \item \code{MeshToMeshFilter}: a filter that transforms meshes, such as
  tessellation, polygon reduction, and so on.

  \item \code{LightObject}: abstract base for filters that don't fit well
  anywhere else in the class hierarchy.  Also useful for ``calculator''
  filters; ie. a sink filter that takes an input and calculates a result
  which is retrieved using a \code{Get()} method.

\end{itemize}

Once the appropriate superclass is identified, the filter writer
implements the class defining the methods required by most all ITK
objects: \code{New()}, \code{PrintSelf()}, and protected constructor,
copy constructor, delete, and operator=, and so on. Also, don't forget
standard typedefs like \code{Self}, \code{Superclass}, \code{Pointer}, and
\code{ConstPointer}. Then the filter writer can focus on the most important
parts of the implementation: defining the API, data members, and other
implementation details of the algorithm. In particular, the filter writer
will have to implement either a \code{GenerateData()} (non-threaded) or
\code{ThreadedGenerateData()} method. (See Section~\ref{sec:MultiThreading}
for an overview of multi-threading in ITK.)

An important note: the GenerateData() method is required to allocate memory
for the output. The ThreadedGenerateData() method is not. In default
implementation (see \doxygen{itk}{ImageSource}, a superclass of
\doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageFilter})
\code{GenerateData()} allocates memory and then invokes
\code{ThreadedGenerateData()}.

One of the most important decisions that the developer must make is whether
the filter can stream data; that is, process just a portion of the input to
produce a portion of the output. Often superclass behavior works well: if the
filter processes the input using single pixel access, then the default
behavior is adequate. If not, then the user may have to a) find a more
specialized superclass to derive from, or b) override one or more methods
that control how the filter operates during pipeline execution. The next
section describes these methods.



\section{Streaming Large Data}
\label{sec:StreamingLargeData}
\index{pipeline!streaming large data}

The data associated with multi-dimensional images is large and becoming larger.
This trend is due to advances in scanning resolution, as well as increases in
computing capability. Any practical segmentation and registration software
system must address this fact in order to be useful in application. ITK
addresses this problem via its data streaming facility.

In ITK, streaming is the process of dividing data into pieces, or regions,
and then processing this data through the data pipeline. Recall that the
pipeline consists of process objects that generate data objects, connected
into a pipeline topology. The input to a process object is a data object
(unless the process initiates the pipeline and then it is a source process
object). These data objects in turn are consumed by other process objects,
and so on, until a directed graph of data flow is constructed. Eventually the
pipeline is terminated by one or more mappers, that may write data to
storage, or interface with a graphics or other system. This is illustrated in 
figures \ref{fig:DataPipeLineOneConnection} and \ref{fig:DataPipeLine}.

A significant benefit of this architecture is that the relatively complex
process of managing pipeline execution is designed into the system. This
means that keeping the pipeline up to date, executing only those portions of
the pipeline that have changed, multithreading execution, managing memory
allocation, and streaming is all built into the architecture. However, these
features do introduce complexity into the system, the bulk of which is seen
by class developers. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the pipeline
execution process in detail, with a focus on data streaming.


\subsection{Overview of Pipeline Execution}
\label{sec:OverviewPipelineExecution}
\index{pipeline!overview of execution}

The pipeline execution process performs several important functions.

\begin{figure}
  \par\centering
  \resizebox{5in}{!}{ \includegraphics{DataPipeline.eps}} 
  \itkcaption[The Data Pipeline]{The Data Pipeline}
  \label{fig:DataPipeLine}
  \par
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
        \item It determines which filters, in a pipeline of filters, need to
        execute. This prevents redundant execution and minimizes overall
        execution time.

        \item It initializes the (filter's) output data objects, preparing
        them for new data.  In addition, it determines how much memory each
        filter must allocate for its output, and allocates it.

        \item The execution process determines how much data a filter must
        process in order to produce an output of sufficient size for
        downstream filters; it also takes into account any limits on memory
        or special filter requirements. Other factors include the size of
        data processing kernels, that affect how much data input data 
        (extra padding) is required.

        \item It subdivides data into subpieces for multithreading. (Note
        that the division of data into subpieces is exactly same problem as
        dividing data into pieces for streaming; hence multithreading comes
        for free as part of the streaming architecture.)

        \item It may free (or release) output data if filters no longer need
        it to compute, and the user requests that data is to be
        released. (Note: a filter's output data object may be considered a
        ``cache''. If the cache is allowed to remain (\code{ReleaseDataFlagOff()}) 
        between pipeline execution, and the filter, or the input to the 
        filter, never changes, then process objects downstream of the filter 
        just reuse the filter's cache to re-execute.)
\end{enumerate}

To perform these functions, the execution process negotiates with the
filters that define the pipeline. Only each filter can know how much data is
required on input to produce a particular output. For example, a shrink
filter with a shrink factor of two requires an image twice as large (in terms
of its x-y dimensions) on input to produce a particular size output. An
image convolution filter would require extra input (boundary padding)
depending on the size of the convolution kernel. Some filters require the
entire input to produce an output (for example, a histogram), and have the
option of requesting the entire input. (In this case streaming does not work
unless the developer creates a filter that can request multiple pieces,
caching state between each piece to assemble the final output.)


\begin{figure}
  \par\centering
  \resizebox{5in}{!}{ \includegraphics{DataPipelineUpdate.eps}} 
  \itkcaption[Sequence of the Data Pipeline updating mechanism]{Sequence of the
Data Pipeline updating mechanism}
  \label{fig:DataPipeLineUpdate}
  \par
\end{figure}


Ultimately the negotiation process is controlled by the request for data of a
particular size (i.e., region). It may be that the user asks to process a
region of interest within a large image, or that memory limitations result in
processing the data in several pieces. For example, an application may
compute the memory required by a pipeline, and then use
\doxygen{itk}{StreamingImageFilter} to break the data processing into several pieces.
The data request is propagated through the pipeline in the upstream
direction, and the negotiation process configures each filter to produce
output data of a particular size.

The secret to creating a streaming filter is to understand how this
negotiation process works, and how to override its default behavior by using
the appropriate virtual functions defined in \doxygen{itk}{ProcessObject}. The next
section describes the specifics of these methods, and when to override
them. Examples are provided along the way to illustrate concepts.


\subsection{Details of Pipeline Execution}
\label{sec:DetailsPipelineExecution}
\index{pipeline!execution details}

Typically pipeline execution is initiated when a process object
receives the \code{ProcessObject::Update()} method invocation. This
method is simply delegated to the output of the filter, invoking the
\code{DataObject::Update()} method. Note that this behavior is typical
of the interaction between ProcessObject and DataObject: a method
invoked on one is eventually delegated to the other. In this way the
data request from the pipeline is propagated upstream, initiating data
flow that returns downstream.

The \code{DataObject::Update()} method in turn invokes three other methods:

\begin{itemize}
        \item \code{DataObject::UpdateOutputInformation()}
        \item \code{DataObject::PropagateRequestedRegion()}
        \item \code{DataObject::UpdateOutputData()}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{UpdateOutputInformation()}
\label{sec:UpdateOutputInformation}
\index{pipeline!UpdateOutputInformation}

The \code{UpdateOutputInformation()} method determines the pipeline modified
time. It may set the RequestedRegion and the LargestPossibleRegion depending
on how the filters are configured. (The RequestedRegion is set to process all
the data, i.e., the LargestPossibleRegion, if it has not been set.) The
UpdateOutputInformation() propagates upstream through the entire pipeline and
terminates at the sources.

During \code{UpdateOutputInformation()}, filters have a chance to override the
\code{ProcessObject::GenerateOutputInformation()} method
(\code{GenerateOutputInformation()} is invoked by
\code{UpdateOutputInformation()}). The default behavior is for the
\code{GenerateOutputInformation()} to copy the metadata describing the input
to the output (via \code{DataObject::CopyInformation()}). Remember, information
is metadata describing the output, such as the origin, spacing,
and LargestPossibleRegion (i.e., largest possible size) of an image.

A good example of this behavior is \doxygen{itk}{ShrinkImageFilter}. This filter
takes an input image and shrinks it by some integral value. The result is that
the spacing and LargestPossibleRegion of the output will be different to that 
of the input. Thus, \code{GenerateOutputInformation()} is overloaded.

\subsubsection{PropagateRequestedRegion()}
\label{sec:PropagateRequestedRegion}
\index{pipeline!PropagateRequestedRegion}

The \code{PropagateRequestedRegion()} call propagates upstream to 
satisfy a data request. In typical application this data request is usually the
LargestPossibleRegion, but if streaming is necessary, or the user is
interested in updating just a portion of the data, the RequestedRegion may be
any valid region within the LargestPossibleRegion.

The function of \code{PropagateRequestedRegion()} is, given a request
for data (the amount is specified by RequestedRegion), propagate
upstream configuring the filter's input and output process object's to
the correct size. Eventually, this means configuring the
BufferedRegion, that is the amount of data actually allocated.

The reason for the buffered region is this: the output of a filter may be
consumed by more than one downstream filter. If these consumers each request
different amounts of input (say due to kernel requirements or other padding
needs), then the upstream, generating filter produces the data to satisfy
both consumers, that may mean it produces more data than one of the
consumers needs.

The \code{ProcessObject::PropagateRequestedRegion()} method invokes
three methods that the filter developer may choose to overload.

\begin{itemize}
        \item \code{EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(DataObject *output)} gives the
        (filter) subclass a chance to indicate that it will provide more data
        than required for the output. This can happen, for example, when a
        source can only produce the whole output (i.e., the
        LargestPossibleRegion).

        \item \code{GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(DataObject *output)} gives 
        the subclass a chance to define how to set the requested regions for 
        each of its outputs, given this output's requested region.  The default
        implementation is to make all the output requested regions the same.
        A subclass may need to override this method if each output is a
        different resolution. This method is only overridden if a filter has
        multiple outputs.

        \item \code{GenerateInputRequestedRegion()} gives the subclass a 
        chance to
        request a larger requested region on the inputs. This is necessary
        when, for example, a filter requires more data at the ``internal''
        boundaries to produce the boundary values - due to kernel operations
        or other region boundary effects.
\end{itemize}

\doxygen{itk}{RGBGibbsPriorFilter} is an example of a filter that needs to
invoke \code{EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion()}. The designer of this
filter decided that the filter should operate on all the data. Note
that a subtle interplay between this method and
\code{GenerateInputRequestedRegion()} is occurring here. The default
behavior of \code{GenerateInputRequestedRegion()} (at least for
\doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageFilter}) is to set the input RequestedRegion to
the output's ReqestedRegion. Hence, by overriding the method
\code{EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion()} to set the output to the
LargestPossibleRegion, effectively sets the input to this filter to
the LargestPossibleRegion (and probably causing all upstream filters
to process their LargestPossibleRegion as well. This means that the
filter, and therefore the pipeline, does not stream. This could be
fixed by reimplementing the filter with the notion of streaming built
in to the algorithm.)

\doxygen{itk}{GradientMagnitudeImageFilter} is an example of a filter that needs to
invoke \code{GenerateInputRequestedRegion()}. It needs a larger input requested
region because a kernel is required to compute the gradient at a pixel. Hence
the input needs to be ``padded out'' so the filter has enough data to compute
the gradient at each output pixel.

\subsubsection{UpdateOutputData()}
\label{sec:UpdateOutputData}
\index{pipeline!UpdateOutputData}

\code{UpdateOutputData()} is the third and final method as a result of the
\code{Update()} method. The purpose of this method is to determine whether a
particular filter needs to execute in order to bring its output up to date. (A
filter executes when its \code{GenerateData()} method is invoked.) Filter
execution occurs when a) the filter is modified as a result of modifying an
instance variable; b) the input to the filter changes; c) the input data has
been released; or d) an invalid RequestedRegion was set previously and the
filter did not produce data. Filters execute in order in the downstream
direction.  Once a filter executes, all filters downstream of it must also
execute.

\code{DataObject::UpdateOutputData()} is delegated to the DataObject's source
(i.e., the ProcessObject that generated it) only if the DataObject needs to be
updated. A comparison of modified time, pipeline time, release data flag, and
valid requested region is made. If any one of these conditions indicate that
the data needs regeneration, then the source's
\code{ProcessObject::UpdateOutputData()} is invoked. These calls are made
recursively up the pipeline until a source filter object is encountered, or the
pipeline is determined to be up to date and valid. At this point, the recursion
unrolls, and the execution of the filter proceeds. (This means that the output
data is initialized, StartEvent is invoked, the filters \code{GenerateData()}
is called, EndEvent is invoked, and input data to this filter may be released,
if requested. In addition, this filter's InformationTime is updated to the
current time.)

The developer will never override \code{UpdateOutputData()}. The developer need
only write the \code{GenerateData()} method (non-threaded) or
\code{ThreadedGenerateData()} method. A discussion of threading follows in the
next section.


\section{Threaded Filter Execution}
\label{sec:ThreadedFilterExecution}
\index{pipeline!ThreadedFilterExecution}

Filters that can process data in pieces can typically multi-process
using the data parallel, shared memory implementation built into the
pipeline execution process. To create a multithreaded filter, simply
define and implement a \code{ThreadedGenerateData()} method. For
example, a \doxygen{itk}{ImageToImageFilter} would create the method:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    void ThreadedGenerateData(const OutputImageRegionType& 
                              outputRegionForThread, itk::ThreadIdType threadId)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The key to threading is to generate output for the output region given (as
the first parameter in the argument list above). In ITK, this is simple to do
because an output iterator can be created using the region provided. Hence
the output can be iterated over, accessing the corresponding input pixels as
necessary to compute the value of the output pixel.

Multi-threading requires caution when performing I/O (including using
\code{cout} or \code{cerr}) or invoking events. A safe practice is to allow 
only thread id zero to perform I/O or generate events. (The thread id is
passed as argument into \code{ThreadedGenerateData()}).  If more than one
thread tries to write to the same place at the same time, the program can
behave badly, and possibly even deadlock or crash.


\section{Filter Conventions}
\label{sec:FilterConventions}
\index{pipeline!filter conventions}

In order to fully participate in the ITK pipeline, filters are expected to
follow certain conventions, and provide certain interfaces.  This section
describes the minimum requirements for a filter to integrate into the ITK
framework.

The class declaration for a filter should include the macro
\code{ITK\_EXPORT}, so that on certain platforms an export declaration can be
included. 

A filter should define public types for the class itself (\code{Self}) and
its \code{Superclass}, and \code{const} and non-\code{const} smart pointers,
thus:

\begin{verbatim}
  typedef ExampleImageFilter                Self;
  typedef ImageToImageFilter<TImage,TImage> Superclass;
  typedef SmartPointer<Self>                Pointer;
  typedef SmartPointer<const Self>          ConstPointer;
\end{verbatim}

The \code{Pointer} type is particularly useful, as it is a smart pointer
that will be used by all client code to hold a reference-counted
instantiation of the filter. 

Once the above types have been defined, you can use the following
convenience macros, which permit your filter to participate in the object
factory mechanism, and to be created using the canonical \code{::New()}:

\begin{verbatim}
  /** Method for creation through the object factory. */
  itkNewMacro(Self);  

  /** Run-time type information (and related methods). */
  itkTypeMacro(ExampleImageFilter, ImageToImageFilter);
\end{verbatim}

The default constructor should be \code{protected}, and provide sensible
defaults (usually zero) for all parameters.  The copy constructor and
assignment operator should be declared \code{private} and not implemented,
to prevent instantiating the filter without the factory methods (above). 

Finally, the template implementation code (in the \code{.hxx} file) should
be included, bracketed by a test for manual instantiation, thus:

\begin{verbatim}
#ifndef ITK_MANUAL_INSTANTIATION
#include "itkExampleFilter.hxx"
#endif
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Optional}
\label{sec:FilterPrinting}
\index{pipeline!printing a filter}

A filter can be printed to an \code{std::ostream} (such as \code{std::cout})
by implementing the following method:

\begin{verbatim}
  void PrintSelf( std::ostream& os, Indent indent ) const;
\end{verbatim}

\noindent and writing the name-value pairs of the filter parameters to the
supplied output stream.  This is particularly useful for debugging.

\subsection{Useful Macros}
\label{sec:UsefulMacros}
\index{pipeline!useful macros}

Many convenience macros are provided by ITK, to simplify filter coding. 
Some of these are described below:

\begin{description}
\item [itkStaticConstMacro] Declares a static variable of the given type,
  with the specified initial value. 
\item [itkGetMacro] Defines an accessor method for the specified scalar data
  member.  The convention is for data members to have a prefix of
  \code{m\_}. 
\item [itkSetMacro] Defines a mutator method for the specified scalar data
  member, of the supplied type.  This will automatically set the
  \code{Modified} flag, so the filter stage will be executed on the next
  \code{Update()}. 
\item [itkBooleanMacro] Defines a pair of \code{OnFlag} and \code{OffFlag}
  methods for a boolean variable \code{m\_Flag}.
\item [itkGetObjectMacro, itkSetObjectMacro] Defines an accessor and mutator
  for an ITK object.  The Get form returns a smart pointer to the object.
\end{description}

Much more useful information can be learned from browsing the source in
\code{Code/Common/itkMacro.h} and for the \doxygen{itk}{Object} and
\doxygen{itk}{LightObject} classes.
